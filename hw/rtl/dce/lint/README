Spyglass lint runs with the default lint/lint_rtl goal with the following modification

----------
REMOVED RULES
----------

W240: An input has been declared but is not read
Reason: ESLint can clean up some of these and sometime we just decide not to use some signals in a module (such as ready port of a non-backpressuring FIFO)

FlopEConst: Reports permanently disabled or enabled flip-flop enable pins
Reason: this is not a functional error, though we could optimize our logics based on this

CMD_overloadrule01:
Reason:

WRN_69: 
Reason:

STARC05-1.3.1.3: Do not use asynchronous reset/preset signals as non-reset/preset or synchronous reset/preset signals
Reason: We don't do this by design. The only place we do this is to ensure de-asserted valid and ready when reset is asserted

STARC05-2.11.3.1: Ensure that the sequential and combinational parts of an FSM description should be in separate always blocks
Reason: 

----------
ADDED RULES
----------

W164a: Identifies assignments in which the LHS width is less than the RHS width
Reason: width mismatch between RHS and LHS is never good

W164b: Identifies assignments in which the LHS width is greater than the RHS width
Reason: width mismatch between RHS and LHS is never good

W164c: LHS width is greater than RHS width of assignment (Extension)
Reason: width mismatch between RHS and LHS is never good

W415a: Signal may be multiply assigned (beside initialization) in the same scope
Reason: multiple driven nets will cause synthesis and formality problem

W443: 'X' value used
Reason: We should never generate X in our logics (we should be able to take X as inputs though)

W444: 'Z' or '?' value used
Reason: We should never generate Z in our logics (we should be able to take Z as inputs though)

W576: Logical operation on a vector
Reason: Vectors must be reduced to 1 bit in order to use logical operations
