<p>The clock power adapter is a bidirectional adapter that is used when ATP links traverse a switchable clock or power-domain boundary. It performs the following functions:</p><ol><li>Indicates to the PMA slave if any outstanding requests haven't received responses yet.</li><li>It responds with error responses to requests coming from a clock or power domain that is switched on, if the other domain is switched off.</li></ol><p>Below is block diagram that shows the two domains with the request and response paths:</p><p> </p><p><span class="confluence-embedded-file-wrapper image-center-wrapper"><img class="confluence-embedded-image image-center" src="https://arterisip.atlassian.net/wiki/download/attachments/16169576/image2020-1-29%2016:49:22.png?api=v2"></span></p><p> </p><p>Since it is a bidirectional adapter there are two pairs of ATP ingress and egress link pairs - one for the request path and the other for the response path.</p><h2 id="id-3.4.1-Clockpoweradapter-Parameters">Parameters</h2><p>The block requires the following parameters to generate the RTL:</p><ol><li><strong>maxOutstandingReqs</strong> : Maximum number of outstanding requests before which it applies back-pressure on the request path. A positive integer greater than or equal to 2. This sets the width of an internal counter that is used to indicate the PMA slave interface of any outstanding transactions.</li><li><strong>aFifoDepth</strong>: A positive power of 2 which sets the depth of FIFOs used to synchronize the request and response links across the two clock domains. These are either synchronous or asynchronous depending on the parameter 'async' below.</li><li><strong>hFifoDepth</strong>: A postive power of 2 which sets the depth of the synchronous FIFO that is used to buffer in requests that need to responded with error responses.</li><li><strong>async</strong>: This is a boolean value - 'true' or 'false'. True indicates that the two domains are asynchronous. False indicates that they are asynchronous.</li></ol>
