<p>Symphony supports quality of service by employing multiple mechanisms that tackle congestion at multiple levels and by making sure that flows are routed through the network in a fashion that reduces overall congestion. Routing of flows is automatically done by Maestro, when the ARTG (automatic routing topology generation) module is used. Symphony employs congestion management controls at two levels. These levels along with the controls are described below: </p><p>Transient Congestion Controls: </p><p>Transient congestion control mechanism deals with short term congestion. In interconnects, transient congestion is caused when two or more packets contend for the same output port. Symphony deals with this transient situation by using the appropriate scheduling algorithms in the arbiters present in the ATUs, and the switches, and by using link-by-link flow control. Symphony supports the following basic scheduling algorithms plus slight variations of these: </p><ul><li style="list-style-type: none;background-image: none;"><ul><li style="list-style-type: none;background-image: none;"><ul><li style="list-style-type: none;background-image: none;"><ul><li>Round Robin</li></ul></li><li style="list-style-type: none;background-image: none;"><ul><li>Weighted Round Robin</li></ul></li><li style="list-style-type: none;background-image: none;"><ul><li>Priority Round Robin </li></ul></li></ul></li></ul></li></ul><p>Symphony scheduling algorithms are also designed in a way to prevent deadlocks, reduce jitter and apportion bandwidth in weighted manner. Priority scheduling has the potential to cause starvation. However, this is prevented by the use of starvation counters wherever Priority scheduling is implemented. </p><p>When Virtual Channels are used in the network, each multiport network element such as Switches, have a two level hierarchical scheduler on each output port. The first level arbitrates between the input ports connected to the output VC and the second level arbitrates between the VCs. Each arbiter can have a different arbitration algorithm. In some cases, the second level arbiter can be a priority arbiter and the first level a round robin arbiter. </p><p>Sustained Congestion Controls:</p><p>Sustained congestion is defined as congestion that persists for a much longer period of time than transient congestion. Symphony has two sustained congestion control mechanisms. These are: 1) Rate controller in the IATUs; and 2) End-to-end credit management. The Rate controller as defined in the Credit Management section, will limit the amount of traffic an I-ATU can inject in to the Interconnect. The rate controller supports different of traffic profiles which can be configured at initialization time. The rate controller is a static control, that is, once set it cannot be modified. Credit Management on the other hand provides dynamic control of the traffic injection rate in to the Interconnect. The credit management mechanism will dynamically adjust the injection rate based on the congestion in the interconnect and the slave by regulating the return of the credits to the Initiator. Both controls are required to prevent sustained congestion in the network.</p><p>Traffic isolation is also made possible by the use of Virtual Channels. Different traffic classes are mapped to different VCs and by using appropriate arbitration algorithms in the ATUs and switches the interconnect can offer different latency and bandwidth to each class. </p><p> </p>
