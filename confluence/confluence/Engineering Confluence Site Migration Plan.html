<p>In part for ISO-26262 compliance and because it is best practice, we are writing new or modernizing/improving existing Ncore product engineering and process documentation. In the past, this site: <a href="https://arterisip.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/ENGR">https://arterisip.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/ENGR</a>  has performed the fore-mentioned function. However, it has become largely obsolete and, anyway, largely owned by people who are no longer with Arteris. Also, the name “Engineering” reflects a time when there was only one engineering organization at Arteris which, of course, is no longer true.</p><p>IT has created for us a new site: <a href="https://arterisip.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/SUE">SIP US Engineering</a> or SUE. Currently the site is empty.</p><p>The plan is to determine a proper organization for the new site, migrate pages from other sites that are relevant, and continue to document our products, systems, and processes. The existing site will continue to as a historical archive, but it will become write-protected and disguised as to avoid anyone mistaking it for containing current documentation.</p><p>The current site shows a somewhat chaotic organization that can happen over time. Now is our chance to organize it as suits our current purposes. Also, the page owners on the old site are very often EEs that are no longer with the company. We need active owners for every page we create on the new site. We need someone (probably Bernard and me) to maintain the organization of the site.</p><h2 id="EngineeringConfluenceSiteMigrationPlan-IdentifiedPagestobeMigratedtoNewSite">Identified Pages to be Migrated to New Site</h2><ul><li><p><a href="https://arterisip.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/ENGR/pages/221151379/SIP+Engineering+-+DevOps" data-linked-resource-id="221151379" data-linked-resource-version="2" data-linked-resource-type="page">SIP Engineering - DevOps</a> </p></li><li><p><a href="https://arterisip.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/ENGR/pages/310247496/Ncore+Customer+Release+Procedure" data-linked-resource-id="310247496" data-linked-resource-version="16" data-linked-resource-type="page">Maestro Customer Release Procedure</a> </p></li></ul><h2 id="EngineeringConfluenceSiteMigrationPlan-CurrentSiteOrganizationProposal">Current Site Organization Proposal</h2><p>TBD</p>
