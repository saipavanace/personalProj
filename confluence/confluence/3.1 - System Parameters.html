<p>In order for Maestro to generate the right Symphony RTL and be able to correctly configure the Symphony Interconnect, Maestro needs the user to define certain system level parameters. System level parameters govern the behavior of the whole Interconenct and are divided into three broad classes. These parameters are: </p><ol><li>Global Parameters</li><li>Network Parameters</li><li>Fabric Parameters</li></ol><p>Global Parameters vary from Network and Fabric parameters and as the name suggests, apply to the whole Interconnect which my contain many networks and Fabrics. The Network and Fabric parameters on the other hand only apply to specific networks and fabrics with the network. Note that a network may be composed of multiple fabrics.</p><h3 id="id-3.1-SystemParameters-GlobalParameters">Global Parameters</h3><p>There are three key Global Parameters that need to be defined. They are: </p><ol><li>System Address Map</li><li>System Flow Map</li><li>Power and Clock Definitions</li></ol><p>The system address map defines the addresses and ranges for all the targets in the system and the different address modes and a method of defining these separate modes. Separate address modes could be setup for boot, normal operation and any other mode the user wants. </p><p>The system flow map defines the socket level connectivity, that is, the flow map defines which initiators  talk to which targets and what are the bandwidth and latency requirements for that flow.</p><p>The Power and Clock Definitions define the clocks and power that the design will use. That is the user defines clock and power domain and regions for the design. </p><h3 id="id-3.1-SystemParameters-NetworkParameters">Network Parameters</h3><p>The following network parameters need to be defined by the user: </p><ol><li>MaxPkt - The maximum packet size in bytes that is allowed in the network.</li><li>lckStyleVld - true/false</li><li>numPri - Number of packet priorities supported in the network.</li><li>numVc - Number of virtual channels supported in the network. </li><li>numVn - Number of virtual networks supported in the network. </li><li>Socket Parameters - Varies by Native Protocol Type, See ATUs for parameters below.</li></ol><h3 id="id-3.1-SystemParameters-FabricParameters">Fabric Parameters</h3><ol><li>Type of Fabric Topology, that is, whether the topology is a regular topology or irregular and if regular than which type. </li><li>mstrArbLck - true/false</li></ol>
