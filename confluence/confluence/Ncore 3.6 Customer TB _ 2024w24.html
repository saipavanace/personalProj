Both of them were fixed.</p></li><li><p>Started running regressions and cleaning up the failures with new customer TB</p></li><li><p>Opened a Maestro ticket which is supposed to dump the cadence directory. We need this before we can say Maestro is working fine</p></li><li><p>Working on scoping out the effort for csrCompile integration. We made few script changes to take in csrCompile instead of ralgen. But currently facing few issues. Working on resolving them</p></li><li><p>For the external customer, we currently have a problem. We either have to give me ralgen, or csrCompile or something other tool and ask them to generate the register file themselves. To overcome this, I added a register generation script called “reg_gen“ which can be integrated into Maestro, after which, the customer will always have the register file and they done have to do anything else.</p></li></ol><p><u>Completed tickets:</u><br/>NCOR-579</p><p>NCOR-531</p><p><u>Working On:</u></p><p>CONC-14714 (maestro issues)</p><ul><li><p>CONC-14715, CONC-14716, CONC-14718</p></li></ul><p><u>Open Maestro Tickets:</u></p><p>MAES-7336, MAES-7339, MAES-7341, MAES-7342, MAES-7343</p><p /><p><u>Last 2 weeks tickets:</u></p><p> </p><a class="external-link" data-card-appearance="block" data-datasource="{&quot;id&quot;:&quot;d8b75300-dfda-4519-b6cd-e49abbd50401&quot;,&quot;parameters&quot;:{&quot;jql&quot;:&quot;project in (Concerto, \&quot;Maestro \&quot;, \&quot;Ncore 3\&quot;) AND ( component = CUSTOMER-TB OR labels = \&quot;customer_tb\&quot; ) AND created >= -2w&quot;,&quot;cloudId&quot;:&quot;9dd24424-8834-4688-b5a4-a19c9315e7f0&quot;},&quot;views&quot;:[{&quot;type&quot;:&quot;table&quot;,&quot;properties&quot;:{&quot;columns&quot;:[{&quot;key&quot;:&quot;issuetype&quot;},{&quot;key&quot;:&quot;key&quot;},{&quot;key&quot;:&quot;summary&quot;},{&quot;key&quot;:&quot;assignee&quot;},{&quot;key&quot;:&quot;priority&quot;},{&quot;key&quot;:&quot;status&quot;},{&quot;key&quot;:&quot;updated&quot;}]}}]}" href="https://arterisip.atlassian.net/jira/software/c/projects/CONC/issues/?filter=myopenissues&amp;jql=project%20in%20%28Concerto%2C%20%22Maestro%20%22%2C%20%22Ncore%203%22%29%20AND%20%28%20component%20%3D%20CUSTOMER-TB%20OR%20labels%20%3D%20%22customer_tb%22%20%29%20AND%20created%20%3E%3D%20-2w" rel="nofollow">https://arterisip.atlassian.net/jira/software/c/projects/CONC/issues/?filter=myopenissues&amp;jql=project%20in%20%28Concerto%2C%20%22Maestro%20%22%2C%20%22Ncore%203%22%29%20AND%20%28%20component%20%3D%20CUSTOMER-TB%20OR%20labels%20%3D%20%22customer_tb%22%20%29%20AND%20created%20%3E%3D%20-2w</a><p> </p>
