<p>Symphony supports the following security features: </p><ol><li>Firewalls</li><li>ARM Trustzone support</li><li>Rate limiters at the I-ATUs. </li></ol><p>Firewalls are unidirectional adapters (to be described later in the Component Library Section) that sit on ATP links and are used to &quot;poison&quot; packets in flight as they traverse the network. When a target (a native protocol block that sources an interface) receives a poisoned packet it prevents the packet from generating traffic on the Native Interface and returns an error packet to the initiator (a native protocol block that receives an interface.) It is the responsibility of the initiator to generate and interrupts of statistics associated with this error packet.</p><p>If a protocol natively supports Trustzone, Symphony will pass Trustzone information from initiators to targets. In addition, for an APB target, trust zone checking over address regions that correspond to the select signals that it generates and will have internal registers that sit in its configuration space that control which address zones are protected or not.</p><p>In order to prevent a denial of service attack, Symphony provides rate limiters in the I-ATUs that would limit the rate at which the I-ATU can send traffic in to the interconnect. </p><p> </p><p>We should not discuss VNs as it is not going to be available in R1</p>
