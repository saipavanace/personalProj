<h2 id="NcoreInstallerFD-Installersandotherdeliverables">Installers and other deliverables</h2><h3 id="NcoreInstallerFD-FlexNoCInstaller">FlexNoC Installer</h3><p>Currently, the FlexNoC installer that is used to create the Ncore installer includes documentation. As part of the bundling of the Ncore installer, the documentation is stripped out. It is proposed that a new FlexNoC installer be created with no documentation.</p><p>Current installer location: <code>/engr/ae/concerto</code></p><p>Documentation-free installer location: <strong>TBD</strong></p><h3 id="NcoreInstallerFD-FlexNoCDocumentationtarball">FlexNoC Documentation tarball</h3><p>It is proposed that a simple tarball of the FlexNoC documentation be created that can be extracted into <code>$FLEXNOC_HOME/share/sw/exported/doc/kbpFN_Arteris</code>. The tarball can be provided to the Ncore installer to be extracted as part of the install process.</p><h3 id="NcoreInstallerFD-FlexNoCOSStarball">FlexNoC OSS tarball</h3><p>Per agreement with Qualcomm, FlexNoC may not be bundled with certain open source software (OSS) components. This will be provided in a tarball to be extracted at install time.</p><h3 id="NcoreInstallerFD-NcoreInstaller">Ncore Installer</h3><p>Currently, the Ncore installer is created by the following process:</p><ol><li>The Conductor release tarball is extracted into a staging area.</li><li>Verilator is extracted into the staging area.</li><li>FlexNoC's OSS tarball is extracted into the location where FlexNoC will be installed to.</li><li>FlexNoC is installed to a tools directory under Conductor with a predefined key.</li><li>FlexNoC documentation is stripped out.</li><li>Conductor and FlexNoC are tarred up and bundled into an installer shell script. </li></ol><p>Instead it is proposed that an Ncore installed be created that only contains Ncore (Conductor and Verilator). This installer can then take a uniquely keyed FlexNoC installer in addition to the OSS tarball and optional documentation tarball to perform the FlexNoC installation into Ncore's install directory. The installer would be invoked by:</p><pre>./Ncore-installer.run -f FlexNoC_installer.run -o FlexNoC_oss.tgz [-k flexnoc_key] [-d FlexNoC_documentation.tgz]</pre><p>The key is only used as part of the uniquification of FlexNoC, not Ncore/Conductor.</p><h2 id="NcoreInstallerFD-Creationofinstalleraspartofregularbuild">Creation of installer as part of regular build</h2><p>As a part of a daily or otherwise regular build process, an Ncore installer will be created and automatically installed in a common location such as <code>/engr/dev/tools/Ncore/latest.</code></p><p>An installer will be comprised of the latest versioned <strong style="line-height: 1.42857;"><code>client</code></strong> package, further comprised of latest versioned packages of all dependencies and subdependencies subject to semver restrictions in <code style="line-height: 1.42857;">package.json</code>, with the exception of <strong style="line-height: 1.42857;"><code>hw</code></strong>, which will be from the latest passing build.</p><p>Two installers will be created, one <strong>normal</strong> as delivered to customers, taking nwjc-compiled packages from a <strong>compiled</strong> NPM registry, and one <strong>debug</strong>, taking packages with full JavaScript source from an internal <strong>debug</strong> NPM registry. The installers will then be made available at <code><a class="external-link" href="http://dev.arteris.com/releases/Ncore" rel="nofollow">http://dev.arteris.com/releases/Ncore</a></code> and <code>/engr/dev/releases/Ncore</code>.</p><p>The debug installer will then be run and installed to <code><span>/engr/dev/tools/Ncore/latest</span></code><span>,</span> using the latest FlexNoC installer available at the &quot;documentation-free installer location&quot; given above. No FlexNoC documentation will be installed as part of this process.</p>
