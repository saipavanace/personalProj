<div>Meeting notes from initial FPGA emulation meeting: 3/22/2017<br/>- Went over Dave's presentation on FPGA emulation (will not<br/>  summarize the points that were covered in the presentation)<br/>- Further conversation on NCore<br/>  - Need ACE/CHI interfaces to be useful for NCore<br/>  - could have AXI traffic only<br/>  - only tests non-coherent bridge and a little of the DCI<br/>  - Does not test AIU<br/>- It was noted that we can't reach the Symphony frequency targets<br/>  in a FPGA implementation<br/>  - Discussion about scaling and that in emulation world, hitting<br/>    IP frequency goal is not needed (you don't go for frequency)<br/>  - Scaled performance<br/>  - Further discussion about timing fails in the FPGA world and<br/>    what they mean for the ASIC/SoC world<br/>- We talked about using a FPGA platform as a simulator accelerator<br/>  - generate transactors<br/>  - go deep on test cases<br/>  - Set up regression with build process making a &quot;random&quot; DUT for<br/>    a given regression<br/>- Some possible FPGA system possibilities:<br/>  - PCIe (root complex) + Symphony</div><div>Questions that came up during the meeting:<br/>- Is there a backdoor way to get to ACE/CHI on one of the FPGA SoCs<br/>- Is there a way to do cosimulation with FPGA? For example, this<br/>  would allow Carbon model simulations to be combined with FPGA<br/>  emulation - which allows for testing our IP (which is what is<br/>  being emulated) with Carbon processor models that drive ACE and CHI<br/>  interfaces into our logic.</div><div><br/>Action Items<br/>------------<br/>- Look into questions that came up during the meeting that were not<br/>  answered (detailed above)<br/>- Look into AWS FPGA acceleration platform and document advantages<br/>  and disadvantages of using it</div>
