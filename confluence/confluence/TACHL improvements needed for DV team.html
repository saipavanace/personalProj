<p>Below are some suggestions put forth by Symphony Verification Team for improvements in TACHL targeted for verification code.</p><p>1.Currently we write a testlist JSON file which compiles the list of files to be processed by TACHL. Instead we would like a way to specify a top file, list of packages needed and TACHL should be able to process the corresponding files of the package by traversing through the given directory list.</p><p>2.Add function to input class attributes and register them to the UVM factory just like how ports are added to the module and defined.This will enable programmers to avoid lengthy typing of methodology related macros and make code more readable and portable.</p><p>3.The bench should be generated via one tachl call. Currently we get a testlist from the JSON file and run TACHL cmd on each and every file from the testlist. This could be easily avoided if TACHL can identify packages,class and interface definitions. Also TACHL should publish a testlist similar to the rtl which can be used by the simulation tool.(this will be very helpful if we want to change the verilog simulators which running our environments).</p><p>4.Change TACHL to output any extensions. Testbenches use a list of file extension .Ex :sv -for system verliog code , .pkg -for packages, .svi for system verilog interface.</p><p> </p><p> </p>
