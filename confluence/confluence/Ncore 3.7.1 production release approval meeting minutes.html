100ps except one unit with a WNS = 106ps.</p><p>The STA is run with RTLA and TSMC 5nm technology node.</p><p>The worst corner is &quot;ssgnp_0p675v_m40c_cworst_CCworst_T.cworst_CCworst_T&quot; and the STA results are reported for that corner.</p><p>Fewer timing violations are reported with the &quot;ssgnp_0p675v_125c_cworst_CCworst_T.rcworst_CCworst_T&quot; corner and the timing is clean with the Typical corner. </p><p><strong>AI #1:</strong> Verify if at least one configuration uses a multi-cycle SRAM and timing report exist</p><p><strong>Answer:</strong> DMI units are by default implemented with multi-cycle SRAMs when supported and timing is validated with them in Ncore 3.7 using &quot;hw_cfg_10_lite&quot; configuration.</p><p><strong>AI #2: </strong>Verify timing with IO-AIUp for Ncore 3.7.1 =&gt; own = Eric H.</p><p><u>Lint results:</u></p><p>There are known violations with severity &quot;error&quot; that are reported by the Synopsys tool and warnings by the Cadence tool.</p><p>Many JIRA tickets related to Lint issues have been resolved for Ncore 3.7 but some tickets are still open until the right timing window is available to fix the code without impacting a product release.<br/>In the meantime, a custom Lint waiver report will be provided to customers that request it. </p><p><u>Open issues waived for that release:</u></p><p>The link to the list of issues is provided in the checklist. 10 JIRA tickets are new versus Ncore 3.6.4.p3 and 11 JIRA tickets are Lint issues.</p><p><strong>Verification signoff status:</strong></p><p>Waiver page created for the regression passing rates not met and it is acceptable (all DV issues): <a href="https://arterisip.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/ENGR/pages/1321042067/Ncore+3.7.1+Regressions+Passing+Rate+Waiver" data-linked-resource-id="1321042067" data-linked-resource-version="1" data-linked-resource-type="page">Ncore 3.7.0 Regressions Passing Rate Waiver</a></p><p>Waiver page created for the code coverage that are not met and it is acceptable (Questa tool issue): <a href="https://arterisip.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/ENGR/pages/1321042108/Ncore+3.7.1+Code+Coverage+Passing+Rate+Waiver" data-linked-resource-id="1321042108" data-linked-resource-version="1" data-linked-resource-type="page">Ncore 3.7.0 Code Coverage Passing Rate Waiver</a></p><p>In addition, the action items below have been created following the review:</p><p><strong>AI #3</strong>: Bandwidth / Latency with IO-AIUp shall be checked and reviewed during weekly meeting =&gt; Own = Eric H./ JP</p><p><strong>AI #4</strong>: a lite signoff review meeting to be setup for Ncore 3.7.1 to assess PCIe/ IO-AIUp/ OWO support =&gt; Own = Bernard</p><p><strong>Emulation:</strong></p><p>Ncore 3.7 RTL has been tested on the emulation platform with 7 configurations and up to 9 arm CPUs.</p><p>All tests pass.</p><p><strong>AI #5</strong>: plan to emulate a PCIe configuration without PCIe IP on the Veloce platform =&gt; Own = Leo</p><p><strong>Maestro signoff:</strong></p><p>All new RTL features support implemented in Maestro.</p><p>Formal checked that a design created with Tcl commands versus GUI are equivalent.</p><p>Writing a configuration in Tcl commands and reading the Tcl file back in Maestro will create the same design in Ncore 3.8.  </p><p><strong>Performance models signoff:</strong></p><p>Only one feature (OWO support) has been implemented and verified .</p><p>Performance tests have been run thoroughly for this release in order to align the performance models with the RTL.</p><p><strong>Documentation signoff:</strong></p><p>Enhanced documentation set with new features description and useful information for the customers is ready and available for the product release.</p><p><strong>Patents:</strong></p><p>2 patents have been filled by the hardware team while Ncore 3.7 was developed.</p><p><strong>QA:</strong></p><p>QA test items are tracked in JAMA. Minor bugs found and JIRA tickets created accordingly.</p><p><strong>Miscellaneous:  </strong></p><p>A new product release is planned middle of April'2025 for releasing the features pushed out from Ncore 3.7.0 product release. <br/>More results will be available at that date, decreasing the number of waivers applicable to the Ncore 3.7 product family.</p><p><strong>Outcome of the signoff meeting:</strong></p><p>Based on the successful signoff data review and positive comments, the outcomes of the signoff meeting is that the Ncore 3.7 product is ready to be released to production.</p><p> </p>
