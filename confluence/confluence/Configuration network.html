This block is mapped to a defined 4 KB page within the Ncore Register Space (NRS). The software running in an Ncore 3-based system has the knowledge about these pages and the units that are mapped to them. The &quot;home&quot; Ncore unit for the NRS addresses is preprogrammed to be a special Ncore 3 unit called the N3CDII.</p><p>To modify the register, CPU1 issues a Write to the appropriate location in the NRS. When the AIU interfacing CPU1 receives this Write, it performs a look-up in the address map within it. The AIU determines that the address belongs to the NRS, and so the Write is forwarded to the home unit of the address, which is the N3CDII.</p><p>When Write arrives at the N3CDII, it simply issues an equivalent Write transaction on it AXI bus.</p><p>The AXI Write is received by the AXI ATU, which is a part of the &quot;Presto&quot; interconnect and which is connected to the N3CDII.</p><p>The AXI ATU contains the NRS Address Map that is used to look up the Write address again. This address map identifies the Ncore unit within whose 4 KB page the Write address falls. This Ncore unit becomes the new &quot;Target&quot; unit for the Write. In our example, it will be the DMI1.</p><p>The AXI ATU then forwards the Write to its Target, i.e. to DMI1, via the Presto network.</p><p>After traversing the Presto network, the Write eventually arrives at DMI1 via the APB ATU. (A single target APB ATU can be connected to up to 8 Ncore units.)</p><p><span data-colorid="wye993enh7" style="text-decoration: none;">Each Ncore unit has an APB interface. This A</span>PB interface can only be used to perform Read and Write accesses to the registers inside that unit.</p><p>Thus, this Write transaction arriving over the APB port doesn't result in DMI1 communicating with the outside world. Instead it simply updates the intended register inside the DMI1.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p>
