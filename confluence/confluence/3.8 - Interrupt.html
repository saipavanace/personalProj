<p>The interrupt block is a block in symphony that accumulates two or more interrupts coming from blocks or a level in the hierarchy and combines them into one signal to send to the next interrupt block or out of the design.</p><p>The block diagram looks like:</p><p><span class="confluence-embedded-file-wrapper confluence-embedded-manual-size"><img class="confluence-embedded-image panning confluence-thumbnail confluence-external-resource" alt="SymphonyInterruptModule.JPG" height="250" src="https://confluence.arteris.com/download/attachments/11700164/SymphonyInterruptModule.JPG?version=1&amp;modificationDate=1556571471511&amp;api=v2" data-image-src="https://confluence.arteris.com/download/attachments/11700164/SymphonyInterruptModule.JPG?version=1&amp;modificationDate=1556571471511&amp;api=v2" loading="lazy"></span></p><p><br/>Both of the registers are read/write and hang off the configuration network. </p><p>The Interrupt Mask Reg can mask an interrupt and prevent it from propagating further. The width of the interrupt mask is the number of input interrupts. Bit 0 of interrupt mask corresponds to interrupt 0, bit 1 corresponds to interrupt 1, and so on. 1 indicates interrupt is enabled. 0 indicates interrupt is disabled. 0 is default value. </p><p>The Interrupt Valid Reg is a one shot per bit that captures pulses and can only be cleared by writing 0 from the configuration network. The width of the interrupt valid is the number of input interrupts. Bit 0 of interrupt valid corresponds to interrupt 0 of input interrupt, bit 1 corresponds to interrupt 1, and so on.  Interrupt valid bit goes to 1 when its current value is 0, and input is 1. Interrupts are cleared by writing 0 to bit corresponding to that interrupt valid bit.</p>
