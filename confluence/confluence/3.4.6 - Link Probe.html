<div><p>The Link Probe sits on an ATP link as a unidirectional adapter. It listens to packet fields of interest and generates events when customer-defined conditions on such fields are met. Below is a block diagram of the Link Probe block:</p><p><span class="confluence-embedded-file-wrapper image-center-wrapper confluence-embedded-manual-size"><img class="confluence-embedded-image image-center" height="400" src="https://arterisip.atlassian.net/wiki/download/attachments/16169603/image2019-11-5%2015:16:13.png?api=v2"></span></p><p> </p><p>The user-defined conditions are specified through a parameter, evtDefines (described below). The evtDefines data-structure is also used to infer as many registers and fields as required to generate the conditions.</p><h2 id="id-3.4.6-LinkProbe-Parameters">Parameters</h2><p><strong>baseAddress:</strong> A non-negative integer. This sets the baseAddress for all the registers generated.</p><p><strong>nodeID:</strong> A non-negative integer distinct from that of all other blocks in Symphony.</p><p><strong>evtDefines:</strong> This is an array of objects. Each object defines one of the events generated by the probe. Hence the length of this array corresponds to the number of events generated by the probe. Each object in the array has the following structure:</p><p>{</p><p>  <strong>id</strong>: A non-negative integer distinct from ids of all other events in the array.<br/>  <strong>conditions</strong>: An array of strings each of which is a Verilog expression that describes the condition for generating this event.<br/>}</p><p>The possible Verilog expressions supported in the <em>conditions</em> array and the list of signal names that can be used are limited. Below is a list of supported expressions:</p><ol><li>Expressions with a signal_name or a constant and possibly a unary operator. Ex: &quot;H_tid&quot;, &quot;1'b0&quot;, &quot;3'd2&quot;.</li><li>Expressions with a binary operator separating two signals or a signal and a constant. Only the following list of relational and equality operators are supported: '&gt;', '&lt;', '&gt;=', '&lt;=', '==', '!='. Ex: &quot;H_addr &lt;= cfg_cmp_val1&quot;.</li><li>Expressions with a binary operator separated by expressions of type 1 or 2. The list of operators supported are the same as in 2. Ex: &quot;(H_addr &lt; cfg_cmp_val2)  &amp;&amp; (H_addr &gt; cfg_cmp_val3)&quot;.</li></ol><p>The list of signal names supported are:</p><ol><li>All packet field names. Ex: &quot;H_addr&quot;, &quot;H_msg_id&quot;, &quot;F_data&quot;.</li><li>Configuration register fields. Ex: &quot;cfg_cmp_val0&quot;, &quot;cfg_cmp_val1&quot;.</li><li>List of reference event signals: Ex: &quot;pkt_start&quot;, &quot;pkt_end&quot;, &quot;beat_sent&quot;.</li></ol><p> </p></div>
