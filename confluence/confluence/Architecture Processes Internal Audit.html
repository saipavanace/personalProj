<p>Auditor: John Coddington</p><p>At the moment there is no incremental Specification Modification flow. My proposal is it follows the same flow as the Initial Specification. The numbering used for the various version is dependent on what the version the present spec is at and what the version number desired for the final spec.

not where to find them.</p><p>Correctly answered who to ask if needed to find the documents.</p><p>Had an innate knowledge of the steps the process followed but had never actually read the documents.</p><p>Felt that the steps become more predictable in schedule the closer you got to the end of the process. Felt the first step were hard to define because it was more a discovery process of what the problem is and what the potential solutions are.</p><p>Felt that if you were to do incremental changes to a specification you would follow that same steps but you should be able to do them faster and with more predictability.</p><p>In general, for a real audit the person should have said that they would refer to the documents to determine the steps needed to do instead of try to state them from their innate knowledge. If they felt steps were missing then they would contact the owner of the document and express their concerns.</p><p>Second Interview (from Design) :</p><p>Wasn't sure there there was an architecture process but when I showed them the process he recognized immediately that it was the process that we followed to create the Architecture Document.</p><p>Correctly answered where to look for the process documentation.</p><p>Correctly answerer who to ask where to look for the documentation if they didn't know where it existed.</p><p>Thought the steps were well defined but didn't think the schedule was predictable.</p><p>When asked about what process they would use to do a modification to an architecture document vs. the creation of one they said they would use the process used to create an architecture document.</p><p>When asked if the process of how design uses the architecture document to create the microarchitecture document, they initially said no because the architecture document doesn't specify the restricting conditions used to limit the microarchitecture document, but when I redirected them from the actual work done to the process followed, they decided that the process was well defined.</p><p>In general they did well but should have said that the process exists. </p><p>Third Interview (from Architecture):</p><p>Knew that a process existed, but didn't know the official location, though they thought they did.</p><p>Knew who to ask if they didn't know where a document existed.</p><p>Felt that the process was well defined and the schedule was predictable.</p><p>Wrongly stated that a process existed to modify an existing document, but was thinking about a document control system and not a process. When clarified felt that the existing process to create a document would be the same process to modify the document.</p><p>Overall:</p><p>There wasn't really good agreement on whether this is one process or multiple processes. My own impression is it is one process and best to handle it as such. I have initially broken it into five processes, but I think they are really five steps in a single process. I talked with Sanjay (not one of the interviewees) about this and he thinks the same.</p>
