<p>This page describes the naming conventions for interrupt trees and sub-trees in Symphony. Every interrupt in Symphony of type <a href="https://arterisip.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/ENGR/pages/16160508/InterfaceINT" data-linked-resource-id="16160508" data-linked-resource-version="3" data-linked-resource-type="page">InterfaceINT</a> will be associated with a name that will be read by blocks and passed on to their IPXACT (<a href="https://arterisip.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/ENGR/pages/16169519/IP-XACT+-+IEEE+1685-2014" data-linked-resource-id="16169519" data-linked-resource-version="1" data-linked-resource-type="page">IP-XACT - IEEE 1685-2014</a>) register definitions in order to help accomplish two goals:</p><ol><li>Allow scripts that parse IPXACT register definitions to list interrupt registers at each level of every interrupt tree in the design, which in turn is used by DV to automate ISR code generation.</li><li>Allow a customer to identify which interrupt register and bit affects which of the top-level interrupts defined by them.</li></ol><h2 id="HW-CTFInterrupttreenamingconventionsinSymphony-Howandwheretheyareused">How and where they are used</h2><p>In order to automate the ISR code generation in TB, we need to generate a tree of interrupt registers such that the ISR knows all the interrupt bits to clear at all levels when an interrupt occurs. To generate this tree, the IPXACT register descriptions (strings) are embedded with some meta-data called the Interrupt Map (described here: <a href="https://arterisip.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/ENGR/pages/16329987/HW-CTF+Symphony+Block+Common+Characteristics" data-linked-resource-id="16329987" data-linked-resource-version="1" data-linked-resource-type="page">HW-CTF Symphony Block Common Characteristics</a>).</p><p>The InterruptMap includes information about the sources of all interrupts that sets a given interrupt bit which are specified using the following parameters: BlockID of the source block, source block tree name of the source block. In addition it specifies the ID and tree of the block in which the interrupt register resides. </p><p>The IPXACT register description parsers then search for all the register descriptions with matching Block ID and source tree. Hence the source tree labels / names can be duplicated if Block ID is different, but must be unique for a given Block.</p><p>The Block IDs are passed to the interrupt accumulator block as a parameter. The tree label is specified as part of the interrupt interface because this ensures that the blocks connecting either ends of the interface use the same information to create their Interrupt Maps.</p><h2 id="HW-CTFInterrupttreenamingconventionsinSymphony-Proposal">Proposal</h2><p>The label / name associated with an interrupt interface will be a string with 2 parts separated by an &quot;_&quot;:</p><ol><li>Name of the tree top or top-level interrupt (expected to be specified by the customer).</li><li>An index or suffix to distinguish between the different interrupt trees of the block that generates the interrupt. Skip this if the source block generates only one interrupt (Presto 1.0).</li></ol><p>The above rules will lead to duplication of names for different blocks, which isn't a problem since rule 2 above ensures that the combination of Block ID + tree label will still remain unique for every interrupt register and sub-tree in Symphony design.</p><p>If there are multiple levels of interrupt registers within a sub-block, they are assigned hierarchical sub-block IDs by the block owner. Hence the parameter <em><strong>srcBlockIDs</strong></em> passed to the interrupt accumulator block (<a href="https://arterisip.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/ENGR/pages/16160510/interrupt" data-linked-resource-id="16160510" data-linked-resource-version="22" data-linked-resource-type="page">interrupt</a>) is defined to be an array of strings and not numbers.</p><p><br/></p><p><br/></p><p><br/></p><p><br/></p>
