This sequencer is started at SYM TXN Virtual sequencer.</li><li>Interrupt Sequence: Sequence starts Interrupt service routine task when Interrupt sequencer variable is set to 1.</li><li>Interrupt service routine task:</li></ol><p>          a. Read top interrupt accumulator block register.</p><p>          b. Deduce if block setting interrupt is lower level interrupt accumulator block or regular block eg: ATUI, PMON, Firewall etc.</p><p>          c. If it's regular block then clear the interrupt register of the given block. Else navigate further down till regular block is found.</p><p>          d. Clear corresponding register bit of all interrupt accumulator blocks in the given hierarchy .</p><p>          e. Since Interrupt service routine is inside forever loop go to step 3 and wait for sequencer interrupt variable to be set to 1.</p>
