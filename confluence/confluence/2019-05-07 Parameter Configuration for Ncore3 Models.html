Currently reads in parameters that “Tempo” uses. Need to add few more if we want to use it for performance modelling.</li><li>Example code gives more details.</li><li>Currently JSON file is parsed run time. But for customer deliverable, values must be feed in at compile time if we are not going to ship the JSON file. This is doable with current approach.</li><li>No matter which approach we take this must be solved.</li></ul><li>Slide 3</li><ul><li>Describes how Legato performance model will be generated.</li><li>My understanding is their TACHL code will read generic-wrapper JSON and generate a SystemC model.</li><li>Chandra/Saad might have more inputs.</li></ul><li>Slide 4</li><ul><li>Representation of Ncore Top Performance model that is generated for a specific configuration.</li><li><a class="external-link" href="http://Libncore.so" rel="nofollow">Libncore.so</a> is the shared library that is built by linking libconfig.a, liblegato.a and Ncore Top.</li><li>Ncore.h is the include file for end user to integrate the shared library in their environment</li></ul><li>Slide 5</li><ul><li>This is a reference example to run sample provided tests.</li><li>Are we going to this for current release, what tests to include and are we going to ship over verification components are up for discussion?</li><li>I just put them since it came up while talking to Khalid.</li></ul></ul>
