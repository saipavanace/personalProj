<p>Action Items from feedback:</p><p>MUST DO:</p><ul><li>Do a 2 Stage review for emulation. 1st one at earlier in the project and other at RTL freeze.</li><li><p>Integrating build in Parent stream and doing regular bi-weekly or monthly emulation build updates to keep up with latest builds. </p></li><li><p>Performance improvement for UVM setup - Using veloce friendly tasks/functions to improve performance. </p></li><li><p>Prepare a plan for feature validation targeted for emulation instead of activity based alone. eg. Atomics</p></li><li><p>Automate DSU wrapper integration and build</p></li></ul><p>GOOD TO HAVE:</p><ul><li><p>Get faster response from Mentor by establishing expected response times and process. </p></li><li><p>Enable Satish to verify Mentor updates/release first by running sanity testcase on ARTERIS laptop. </p></li><li>Modify Tempo from more signal based to struct/event based monitor. This will have performance improvements for DV team as well. </li><li>Provide Veloce friendly coding guidelines to design and identify any areas affecting emulation throughput and synthesis specially. </li><li>Develop a Knowledge database. </li><li><p>Testbench code review before check in. </p></li><li><p>Add detailed comments for the code modifications in RTL as well as Testbench for all Phases. </p></li><li><p>More information on Scoreboard for Phase 1 on Confluence. </p></li><li><p>Prepare detailed feature requirement list for CHI, ACE or ACE-lite or any other transactor for Mentor. </p></li></ul><p><br/></p><p>For Phase3 emulation :</p><p>(1) We are able to port fullsys environment with HDL/HVL concept on Veloce emulator. That is perfect. Here the problem is speed. To improve speed, it is better we move from signals to struct/event based scheme to exchange information between HDL-HVL world. This may be some complex activity but worth to do the same for speed improvement.</p><p><br/></p><p>From simulation profile :</p><p>    AdvanceClockCompleted (  ID-14)| ncore_hdl_top.mstr_axi_caiu0.i_xrtl_master.i_advancer    |     250410         |            54.790142 secs    | { 17, 1816, 15 } usec</p><p>             advanceClock ( ID-255)| ncore_hdl_top.mstr_axi_caiu0.i_xrtl_master.i_advancer    |     250540         | { 4, 137, 3 } usec</p><p>             getDutSignal ( ID-201)| ncore_hdl_top.concerto_phys_if    |     250411         | { 20, 157, 18 } usec</p><p>         getDutRespSignal ( ID-200)| ncore_hdl_top.mgc_resp_if    |     250410         | { 20, 1415, 18 } usec</p><p><br/></p><p>(2) hw-scripts/defaultRsim.js and hw-ncr/dv/scripts/rsimMethods.js needs update to support fsys envirionment flow with in parallel with veloce. Here we have not checked in anything and need to make sure that fsys works fine in parallel with emulation changes.</p><p><br/></p>
