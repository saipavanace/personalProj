<p>Hi all,</p><p>Thanks for attending the Ncore 3.6 production release signoff meeting (Dec-7th and Dec-12th) to review the product status</p><p>to confirm there is no gating item for the product to be released to the customers and the QA is successful.</p><p>The supporting data are available in the <a href="https://arterisip.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/ENGR/pages/338165777/Ncore+3.6.0+production+release+checklist" data-linked-resource-id="338165777" data-linked-resource-version="38" data-linked-resource-type="page">Ncore 3.6.0 production release checklist</a> </p><p>See below the notes I have taken and the action items captured during these meetings (Dec-12th incremental notes are highlighted in yellow).</p><p> </p><p>A new issue related to the customer testbench compilation has been analyzed, confirmed as a bug (grouping information are missing in the testbench) and it is blocker for the release.</p><p>Refer to  &quot;CONC-13386 - Ncore_3.6.0-10140 customer TB compilation error&quot; for the details.</p><p>Effort to fix this bug has been estimated to a couple of days so, we are moving forward with this bug fix and the product release is delayed to Dec-12th.</p><p> </p><p>Functional coverage at Full System is not yet a 100% for now because one Functional coverage-bin has still to be created.  Functional coverage for Full System is projected to be completed today or early tomorrow, in line with the product release date of Dec-12th.</p><p> </p><p><strong>RTL signoff status:</strong></p><p><u>Lint results:</u></p><p>No error and low level of warnings that are waivable.</p><p>List of waivers is provided.</p><p><u>RTL open JIRA tickets:</u></p><p>One open RTL bug has been analyzed:</p><ol start="1"><li><p>CONC-13412        [DCE] dmi not present error cannot be generated</p></li></ol><p>The root cause of the failure is that the DCE is not connected to one of the DMI units but there is a transaction with the address mapped to this DMI.</p><p>This issue is not a blocker for the release, it can be kept internal and AEs can find that issue for their reference.</p><p><u>Timing analysis:</u></p><p>DC-NXT run completed for NXP and HW-Config10-Lite configurations and the signoff checklist has been updates with the results. Large timing violations have been discussed mainly the  Macro2Flop violation that will vanish by implementing a Multicycle SRAM.  Multicycle SRAM is tested with Resiltech configuration.</p><p>Waiver page created and it is acceptable: <a href="https://arterisip.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/ENGR/pages/404619283/Ncore+3.6.0+Timing+Violations+Waiver" data-linked-resource-id="404619283" data-linked-resource-version="7" data-linked-resource-type="page">Ncore 3.6.0 Timing Violations Waiver</a> </p><p> </p><p><strong>Verification signoff status:</strong></p><p>HW team switched from Siemens Questa to Synopsys VCS tool including Synopsys VIP.</p><p>Ncore 3.6 coverage had to be run from scratch without being able to reuse any existing waiver.</p><p> </p><p>Few signoff criteria are not met and a new meeting shall be scheduled Dec-12th to review the detailed waiver document for each remaining criteria still not met .</p><p>Waiver page created for the regression passing rates not met and it is acceptable: <a href="https://arterisip.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/ENGR/pages/402980884/Ncore+3.6.0+Regressions+Passing+Rate+Waiver" data-linked-resource-id="402980884" data-linked-resource-version="10" data-linked-resource-type="page">Ncore 3.6.0 Regressions Passing Rate Waiver</a> </p><p>Waiver page created for the code coverage that are not met and it is acceptable: <a href="https://arterisip.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/ENGR/pages/404619303/Ncore+3.6.0+Code+Coverage+Passing+Rate+Waiver" data-linked-resource-id="404619303" data-linked-resource-version="9" data-linked-resource-type="page">Ncore 3.6.0 Code Coverage Passing Rate Waiver</a> </p><p> </p><p>In addition, action items below have been created following the review:</p><p> </p><ul class="inline-task-list" data-inline-tasks-content-id="406160004"><li data-inline-task-id="1"><span class="placeholder-inline-tasks">confirm IO-AIU subsystem/ subsystem Snps fail tests have been analyzed (no RTL issue) and can be waived =&gt; Own = Saad <br/>In progress, data reported in the page: <a href="https://arterisip.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/ENGR/pages/404357180/Ncore+3.6+Regressions+Waivers" data-linked-resource-id="404357180" data-linked-resource-version="1" data-linked-resource-type="page">Ncore 3.6 Regressions Waivers:</a> </span></li></ul><p> </p><ul class="inline-task-list" data-inline-tasks-content-id="406160004"><li data-inline-task-id="2"><span class="placeholder-inline-tasks">Latency measurement, tracking and improvement shall be part of Ncore 3.8  =&gt; Own = Eric H.</span></li></ul><p> </p><p>Nightly Full System Random Regressions results:</p><p>Configuration Random Regressions have been put in low priority and didn't run lately: random regressions run at unit level. </p><ul class="inline-task-list" data-inline-tasks-content-id="406160004"><li data-inline-task-id="3"><span class="placeholder-inline-tasks">Random configuration + Parameter coverage shall be re-enabled in Ncore 3.8 =&gt; Own = Saad</span></li></ul><p> </p><p><strong>Emulation:</strong></p><p>Ncore 3.6 RTL has been tested on the emulation platform with 4 configurations and up to 9 arm CPUs.</p><p>All tests pass.</p><p> </p><ul class="inline-task-list" data-inline-tasks-content-id="406160004"><li data-inline-task-id="4"><span class="placeholder-inline-tasks">plan to emulate an automotive configuration on the Veloce platform =&gt; Own = Leo</span></li><li data-inline-task-id="5"><span class="placeholder-inline-tasks">setup a meeting to define and review the automotive configuration  =&gt; Own = Andy</span></li></ul><p> </p><p><strong>Performance models signoff:</strong></p><p>All the features implemented and verified.</p><p>Performance tests have not been run thoroughly for this release.</p><ul class="inline-task-list" data-inline-tasks-content-id="406160004"><li data-inline-task-id="6"><span class="placeholder-inline-tasks">Improve the performance test coverage and correlation RTL vs. Performance Models on Ncore 3.8 =&gt; Own=Eric H.</span></li></ul><p> </p><p><strong>Maestro signoff:</strong></p><p><u>Code coverage:</u></p><p>Function coverage shall be 80% minimum and the team will work to improve that number.</p><p>GUI test automation with Squish is up and running and will improve the code coverage.</p><p> </p><ul class="inline-task-list" data-inline-tasks-content-id="406160004"><li data-inline-task-id="7"><span class="placeholder-inline-tasks">refine the software signoff criteria =&gt; Own = Ben</span></li></ul><p> </p><p><strong>Documentation signoff:</strong></p><p>Documentation set is ready and available for the product release.</p><p> </p><p><strong>QA:</strong></p><p>QA test items are tracked in JAMA.
