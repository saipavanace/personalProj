<p>Symphony is architected and designed to provide scalable interconnect solution for a wide range of systems from low end IOT to High end multi-core SoCs. Symphony interconnect comprises of several network elements (NE) that carry standard protocols such as AMBA AXI 4/5 or any custom protocol from one end of the network to the other while offering the following services and features:</p><ul><li>End-to-end Quality of Service (QoS)</li><li>End-to-End Credit Management</li><li>Resilient communications</li><li>Fault tolerance.</li><li>Support for multiple virtual and partitioned systems.</li><li>Support for ARM TrustZone.</li><li>Support for error reporting and logging.</li><li>Support for Performance monitoring.</li><li>Support for Multiple Power and clock domains.</li><li>Support for Debug and configuration management.</li><li>Extensive Power Management support at multiple levels.</li><li>ARM P/Q-Channel compatible support for managing power via an external PMU.</li><li>Support for Ordering/Reordering transactions</li></ul><p> </p><p>Symphony has a layered architecture where each layer performs specific set of tasks. In all there are three layers in Symphony. These three layers correspond approximately to the Transactional layer, Network layer and the Data link layer in the OSI model.</p><p>The Transaction layer understands the needs of the native protocol. This layer handles protocols such as AXI, APB, AHB or any custom protocol. The Transaction layer receives transactions from the Protocol Agents and performs the functions necessary to convert the transaction into packets before passing the information to the Network or the Data-link layer as necessary. At the destination end, the Transaction layer receives packets from the Network layer or the Data-link layer and converts the received packets into relevant protocol transactions. The Transaction layer then delivers the transactions to the Protocol Agents.</p><p>Network Layer contains information that is needed to determine the route of the packets from Source to the Destination in the Interconnect, rate limiting, Virtual Channel allocation, protection and all other network level functions which are end-to-end.</p><p>The Data link layer provides the framing, the functions and procedures required to transfer packets between the different entities of the Interconnect. These include creating the switching headers, packet/flit switching, contention resolution at the packet/flit level, etc.  The Data link layer is also responsible for link-by-link flow control and hop-by-hop credit management.</p><p>Symphony has four basic building blocks. These are:</p><ul><li>Arteris Translation Units (ATUs)</li><li>Links</li><li>Switches</li><li>Adapters</li></ul><p>The ATUs connect with the Master/Slave Native Protocol Agents (PA) at the periphery of the Interconnect and symphony interconnect elements via the ATP interface. The Initiator ATU, converts native protocol transactions into packets and injects them into the Interconnect. The target ATU, converts these packets back into native protocol transactions and sends them to the Native Protocol Agent. The links carry the packets from one point to another. The Link is a unidirectional, point-to-point means of communication between a pair of elements in an Interconnect. The link comprises of two unidirectional sets of wires (one set in each direction), one carrying messages and the other carrying information controlling flow of those messages (Link Level Flow Control). The switches operate at the data link layer and forward packets to their destination based on the route selected for the packet.</p><p>Symphony has a whole set of network elements with varying levels of sophistication called Adapters. An adapter is a device that sits on a link and adapts communication attributes from one side to other. An adapter is inserted into a link thereby splitting the link into two parts. In Symphony, an adapter can be a width adapter that is inserted between two network elements of dissimilar widths, or could be an asynch adapter that is inserted between two network elements with dissimilar clocks or they could more sophisticated that connect two different Fabrics together. The adapters perform the following functions:</p><ul><li>Width changes</li><li>Address to target decode</li><li>Clock changes</li><li>Voltage changes</li><li>Connections between fabrics</li><li>VC remapping logic</li></ul><p> </p><p>Firewalls is another set of adapters that Symphony has which are inserted in to the links and have access to information in the packet. They can be programmed to make security, partitioning and other decisions on behalf of the SoC. Figure below illustrates a typical Symphony Fabric.</p><h1 id="id-2.1-SymphonyOverview-"> <span class="confluence-embedded-file-wrapper confluence-embedded-manual-size"><img class="confluence-embedded-image" height="250" src="https://arterisip.atlassian.net/wiki/download/attachments/16169451/image2019-11-3%207:28:35.png?api=v2"></span></h1><p>The chapters to follow will provide details on these network elements and their user visible parameter.</p>
