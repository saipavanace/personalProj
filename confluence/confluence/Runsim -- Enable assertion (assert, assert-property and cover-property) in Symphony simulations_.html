<p>To enable assertions in runsim, it requires two parts:</p><ol><li>Enable Tachl dump for assertions by adding following runsim options to your single simulation “-<strong>rto {\\\&quot;assertOn\\\&quot;:true} -pof 004</strong>” (Please take note of the 3 escapes ‘/’, they are required). RTL has guarded dumping of Assertion code because that makes verilator to fail. That’s why I’vre added -pof 004 in the runsim options above to let the run proceed on verilator fail</li><li>Enable Assertions in Verilog compiler : this has been enabled automatically in the runsim_testlist +define+ASSERT_ON</li></ol>
