They have been fixed and <br/>the bugs status row reports the dates when all the bugs have been closed.</p><p><strong>Lint/ Spyglass checks: </strong></p><p>There is no error but many waived errors and warnings due to known issues (width mismatches) mainly in the IO-AIU block.</p><p>The number of issues has been reduced but the block code has to be re-written to get rid of them.</p><p>This is a concern due to the customer perception about the IP quality when it will find out about all these lint issues.</p><p>The complete list of Lint waivers for Ncore 3.2 is <a class="external-link" href="https://confluence.arteris.com/display/ENGR/LINT+WAIVER+-+Ncore3.2" rel="nofollow">here</a> and same information is in the checklist as well.</p><p>AI: the list of waiver shall be added to the Ncore 3.2 build package =&gt; Own = Ben</p><p><br/></p><p><strong>Open RTL bugs:</strong></p><p>One bug has been reported today on DMI block and it is being analyzed to understand if it is a RTL issue or a Test Bench issue.</p><p><br/></p><p><strong>Timing:</strong></p><p>NXP configuration timing results are reported from DC-NXT run. Timing results with Fusion Compiler are known and tracked</p><p>in separated meeting. For next product, the timing report shall come from RTLA/ FC since DC-NXT is not the signoff tool @ 5nm <br/>technology node.</p><p><u>hw_config_10_lite </u></p><p>The wort violated paths are related to the proxy-cache in ioaiu_top_g block.</p><p>96 OTTs is used because of the large timing violations with 128 OTTs @ 1.6GHz.</p><p>Projection is that the max frequency is limited to 1.2GHz instead of 1.6GHz with the proxy cache and/ or large OTT values.</p><p>AI: Publishes max frequency guidelines for Ncore 3.2 based on the features &amp; OTT values =&gt; Own = Akarsh</p><p>AI: define realistic configurations for Ncore 3.4 timing signoff =&gt; Own = Akarsh/ JP</p><p>AI: Add  hw_config_10_lite configuration description in the checklist =&gt; Own = Bernard</p><p><br/></p><p><strong>JIRA ticket for the release notes:</strong></p><p>The JIRA tickets have been sorted to decide the ones to be added to the release notes that is ready.</p><p>AI: review the release notes =&gt; Own = JP/ Khaleel/ Farnaz</p><p><br/></p><p><strong><u>DV:</u></strong></p><p><strong>Regression passing rate:</strong></p><p>Regression passing rate is ~100% and stable for the past couple of months for the blocks.</p><p>DVE (during the last run) and top level low pass rate is due to compilation failures during the RTL generation. Pass rate projected to be back to ~100% after the next run.</p><p><br/></p><p><strong>Code coverage:</strong></p><p>The code coverage values are passing for all the configurations.</p><p><br/></p><p><strong>Functional coverage</strong></p><p>There is no functional coverage passing criteria: run on a weekly basis with slow progress and judgment on the holes to insure all the functionality is covered.</p><p>The functional coverage is pulled in earlier in the design flow for Ncore 3.4.</p><p><br/></p><p><strong>Latency &amp; performance</strong></p><p>Bandwidth checks are limited to Samsung and NXP configurations.</p><p>Latency numbers have evolved since Ncore 3.0 mainly due to the timing fixes. Values are reported in <a class="external-link" href="https://confluence.arteris.com/display/ENGR/Latency+Numbers+3.2" rel="nofollow">Latency Numbers 3.2</a> confluence page.</p><p><br/></p><p><strong>Emulation<br/></strong>Activity on going with Ncore 3.2 and plan to be put in place for Ncore 3.4 with high priority for both products</p><p><br/></p><p><strong><u>Maestro:</u></strong></p><p>5 bugs are “must fix” for that release.</p><p>Bug related to the IP-XACT issue can not be fully fixed for that release.</p><p>Bug related to adding the daemon in the release build is going to be done.</p><p>Bug related to the deadlock checker is implemented but not fully verified.</p><p>2 other bugs are fixed.</p><p>AI: add the FlexNoc daemon to the build as a work around and figure out how to build it later on =&gt; Own = Ben</p><p>AI: warn AE about possible weakness with the deadlock checker =&gt; Own = JP</p><p><strong><u> </u></strong></p><p><strong><u>Performance models</u></strong></p><p>Potential bug to be reviewed to decide if it is real and whether or not it shall be added to the release notes<br/>AI: review the AN-342 (IOAIU cache doesn't support TagBankSelBits and DataBankSelBits) to decide the next steps =&gt; Own = JP/ Rajat</p><p>Correlation with RTL has improved with few remaining outliers manly with QOS on.</p><p><br/></p><p><strong><u>Documentation:</u></strong></p><p>On line documentation is now functional and sanity checks are on going for the documentation sets.</p><p><br/></p><p><strong><u>QA section</u></strong></p><p>All the tests have been run and fail tests have been fixed or waived.</p><p><br/></p><p><strong><u>Improvement</u></strong></p><p><strong>IP-XACT</strong></p><p>AI: Verification to be added as a requirement to ensure the compatibility with IPD tools =&gt; Own = Bernard</p><p><br/></p><p>Based on the discussion, the Ncore 3.2.0 production build is going to be created to start the checks and be on time for the release scheduled this Friday, 29-April-2022. </p>
