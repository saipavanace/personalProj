<p> </p><p>The release process covers the processes required to create Release Candidates (RC) and the Final Release.</p><p>The RC is created by the engineering team and handed over to the AEs for QA testing once the following goals are met.</p><ul><li>All required functionality and performance has been completely verified</li><li>All Timing goals are at 95%. The 5% fall out must have been analyzed and fixes should not result in any additional latency.   </li><li>All regressions must have at-least 95% pass rate. The 5% fall out must have been debugged and identified as non RTL issues</li><li>There should not be any open RTL bugs and all resolved bugs should be closed</li><li>Code coverage must be at-least at  90% of the target coverage rate.</li><li>Functional coverage must be at-least at 80% of the target coverage rate.</li><li>All GUI features and description should be verified, reviewed and approved by all stake holders </li></ul><p>RC release should follow the following process:</p><ul><li>HW team releases, qualified HW to the SW team </li><li>SW team builds an RC called RC&lt;n&gt;-build&lt;m&gt;.

From the portal, they can track progress of their tickets. The portal is also sending automatically emails to customers every time the ticket status changes.</li><li>Arteris Support Portal Tickets are following the flow shown below (detailed description <a class="external-link" href="https://confluence.arteris.com/download/attachments/4852752/Arteris%20Support%20System%20-%20Customers-Web.pdf?version=1&amp;modificationDate=1499964895468&amp;api=v2" rel="nofollow">here</a>):</li></ul><p> </p><p><span class="confluence-embedded-file-wrapper image-center-wrapper confluence-embedded-manual-size"><img class="confluence-embedded-image image-center" width="500" src="https://arterisip.atlassian.net/wiki/download/attachments/16171014/image2017-7-13%209:34:6.png?api=v2"></span></p><p> </p><ul><li>After the ticket has been filled, an Application Engineer does the initial analysis; and assess if help from Arteris engineering is required. If this is the case, one or multiple tickets are filled in the <a class="external-link" href="https://arterisip.atlassian.net/secure/Dashboard.jspa" rel="nofollow">JIRA</a> engineering database.</li><li>Each ticket has a severity level as specified in the <a class="external-link" href="https://confluence.arteris.com/display/ENGR/Jira+Process" rel="nofollow">Jira Process</a></li><li>Each ticket is also tagged with labels to identify the customer.</li><li>The engineering organization follows the <a class="external-link" href="https://confluence.arteris.com/display/ENGR/Jira+Process" rel="nofollow">Jira Process</a> and makes a recommendation:</li><li>Not an Issue: The issue comes from an incorrect configuration or incorrect diagnostic from the customer. The Application Engineer communicates this information back to the Customer using the corresponding ticket in the Arteris support portal.</li><li>Valid Issue will be fixed: Issue reported by the Customer is a real issue and implies potentially a modification of the product. Arteris engineering and Arteris support decide on an appropriate action:</li></ul><ol><li style="list-style-type: none;background-image: none;"><ol><li>Creation of a patch implying replacement of one or multiple product source files, limited testing, and packaging of a new delivery of the product immediately. This is done of the issue is severe and the customer production flow impacted.</li><li>Decision to fix the problem in a future release, already scheduled and part of the roadmap. This is done if the issue is minor, or customer can wait.</li><li>In addition, if a workaround exists, this is communicated to the customer.</li></ol></li></ol><ul><li>The issue is considered to be definitively fixed once one of the following happen:</li></ul><ol><li style="list-style-type: none;background-image: none;"><ol><li>the customer did not request a modified version of the product and is satisfied with Arteris response (workaround, recommendation)</li><li>the customer required a fixed version of the product, and it has been released.</li></ol></li></ol><ul><li>If an issue is severe and is impacting multiple customers, the Errata document shall be updated immediately, and communicated to every affected Customers. Application Engineering is responsible for deciding which customers will be notified.</li><li>If an issue is not severe, but still affects significantly customers, and it has been decided to fix it in an upcoming release of the product, it is documented in the Errata document for that release.</li></ul><p> </p>
