The strings are base addresses that are either legal Verilog constant literals or hexadecimal number strings that begin with &quot;0x&quot;, each corresponding to a slave driven by one of the APB master interfaces.

Each of the APB slaves are assumed to have an address-space of size 4K and a start address as specified in the <em>baseAddresses</em> array parameter. <br/><br/>Each of the master APB interfaces is assumed to have an address-width of 12 bits to address 4K of memory. And the <em>apbSlaveInterface</em> is assumed to have an address-width that is bigger than 12-bits with the number of additional bits being sufficient to address all the 4K regions.</p>
