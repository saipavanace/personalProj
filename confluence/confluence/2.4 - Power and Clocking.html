Symphony allows the user to turn these domains on/off using the ARM P and Q channel interfaces. Below are definitions that are useful in understanding how Power and Clock are supported in the Symphony system.</p><p>Clocking and Power are defined in terms of regions, domains and sub domains.</p><ol><li>A power region represents a group of elements that run off a power supply that is driven by one power source.</li><li>A clock region represents a group of elements that a clocked by single clock.</li><li>A power domain represents a group of elements that can whose power can be turned on and off.</li><li>A clock domains represents a group of elements whose clock can be turned on and off.</li><li>There are no power sub domains.</li><li>A clock sub domain is a group of elements in a clock domain whose clocks can be turned on and off dynamically as a part of logic function (clock divider).</li></ol><p style="margin-left: 30.0px;">There are a set of rules that control where regions, domains and sub domains can exist.</p><ol><li>Domains must be entirely within a region.</li><li>There can multiple domains in a region.</li><li>There must be at least one domain in a region.</li><li>Sub domains must be entirely within a domain.</li><li>There can be multiple subdomains in a domain.</li><li>For clocks there must at least one sub domain in a domain.</li><li>Clock regions cannot span power regions.</li><li>Multiple clock regions can exist in a power region.</li><li>There must be at least one clock region in a power region.</li><li>Clock domains cannot span power domains.</li><li>There can multiple clock domains in a power domain.</li><li>There must be at least one clock domain in a power domain.</li></ol><p>There are a set of interfaces associated regions and domains.</p><ol><li>Every clock sub domain has a clock interface associated with it. A clock interface is composed minimally as a clock signal and a reset signal, but may include more signals, such as a clock enable signal.</li><li>Every clock domain that a customer needs to turn on and off has either a P-Channel or Q-Channel interface associated with it.</li></ol><p style="margin-left: 30.0px;">As you may have noticed, there are no interfaces associated with power regions and domains. To turn a power domain on an off you turn on and off all the clock domains that are enclosed in a power domain, which leads to the rule:</p><ol><li>To turn a power domain on and off, all clock domains in a power domain must have a P-Channel or Q-Channel interface.</li></ol><p style="margin-left: 30.0px;">For Symphony, the architecture does not define nor provide the functionality of a Power Management Unit (PMU). This is considered provided by the customer and the PMU controls the turning on and off of the various domains within Symphony logic through the P-Channel or Q-Channel interfaces provided. For present implementation.</p><ol><li>All power control interfaces must be all P-Channel or all Q-Channel.</li></ol><p>Add a picture</p></div><div><a class="external-link" href="https://confluence.arteris.com/" rel="nofollow"><span data-colorid="mgzknhp2dz" class="aui-icon aui-icon-small aui-iconfont-like">&nbsp;</span></a><span class="confluence-embedded-file-wrapper confluence-embedded-manual-size"><img class="confluence-embedded-image" height="250" src="https://arterisip.atlassian.net/wiki/download/attachments/16169674/image2019-11-22%2014:39:55.png?api=v2" /></span></div><div><span class="confluence-embedded-file-wrapper confluence-embedded-manual-size"><img class="confluence-embedded-image" height="250" src="https://arterisip.atlassian.net/wiki/download/attachments/16169674/image2019-11-22%2014:40:49.png?api=v2" /></span></div>
