<p>Blocks in Symphony can contain registers that provide a variety of functions</p><ol><li>Interrupts</li><li>Control function</li><li>Report Statistics</li><li>other</li></ol><p>All these registers are referred to globally as configuration registers and sit in a single unified space per block.* The number of registers, their contents and their offsets within the address space for a block are controlled by how the block is configured by Maestro (The customer facing software used to create Symphony NoCs) and their structure is documented using IP-XACT which can be converted into PDF documentation.</p><p>These registers are accessed through the configuration network, which is composed of two sub networks, one for requests and one for responses.</p><p>For the initial release, all blocks with configuration register will have a 4K byte window.</p><p>The interface into the blocks is a standard APB interface and security features, such as trust zone, are controlled through the use of firewalls (to be described later in the Component Library Section) or configuration the APB targets (also to be described later in the Component Library Section.)</p><p>*Except if VN mode for Symphony is enabled, in which case there are a minimum of three spaces created (Hypervisor, Debug and User)</p>
