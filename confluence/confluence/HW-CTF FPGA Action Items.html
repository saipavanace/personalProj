<p><br/></p><div><div>(1) Look into questions that came up during the 3/22 meeting that were not<br/>  answered (see <a href="https://arterisip.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/ENGR/pages/16156973/HW-CTF+Meeting+notes+3+22+2017" data-linked-resource-id="16156973" data-linked-resource-version="1" data-linked-resource-type="page">HW-CTF Meeting notes 3/22/2017</a>)</div><div>- Is there a backdoor way to get to ACE/CHI on one of the FPGA SoCs</div><div>Update from RS - 4/11/2017: <span>Internal SoC Bus Access: We have started the process and are connecting with the internal team, to see if we can get you access to the internal bus models.  We may need to have a conference call with the internal folks, so that you can share more about your project and what you are looking for.</span></div><div>- Is there a way to do cosimulation with FPGA? For example, this<br/>  would allow Carbon model simulations to be combined with FPGA<br/>  emulation - which allows for testing our IP (which is what is<br/>  being emulated) with Carbon processor models that drive ACE and CHI<br/>  interfaces into our logic.</div><div>Update from RS - 4/11/2017: <span>Co-Sim Simulation (Emulation With Simulation): So far in my asking around, I have not been able to find anyone that is doing this.  Everyone is doing both simulation and emulation, but not synchronized together (from what I can tell so far).</span></div><div>(2) Look into AWS FPGA acceleration platform and document advantages<br/>  and disadvantages of using it</div><div>(3) Continue investigations</div></div>
