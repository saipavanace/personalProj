<p>Each release will have two types of errata list:</p><ul><li>Release issue list: Identifies and provides details on issues known at release.</li><li>Errata issue list: Identifies and provides details on issues found after the release.</li></ul><p>Each list will have its own page. The required fields for each issue are:</p><ul><li><strong>Jira# (owner engineering team) </strong><br/>Every issue should have a JIRA associated with it. Note that the Jira may be filled by either team.</li><li><strong>Summary (owner engineering team)</strong><br/>This field describes a brief summary of the issue. </li><li><strong>Severity (owner engineering team)</strong><br/>This field identifies the severity of the issue acceptable entries are:<ul><li><em>Critical: </em>This is a fatal issue and a fix is required before any customer tape out; may or may not have workaround.</li><li><em>Major: </em>This is a fatal issue but has a reasonable workaround, and will not kill a chip.</li><li><em>Minor: </em>This is a non fatal issue; may or may not have a workaround.</li><li><em>Info: </em>This is a non fatal issue which does not have a workaround and has minimal to no effect on functionality. </li></ul></li><li><strong>Problem Description  (owner engineering team)</strong><br/>This field gives details of the issue and describes how it impacts functionality. It should identify all possible ways to detect the issue and elaborate on why the issue has particular severity.</li><li><strong>Workaround Description (owner engineering team)</strong><br/>This field identifies all possible workarounds. </li><li><strong>Comment</strong><br/>This field contains any other comments related to the issue. </li><li><strong>Visibility (owner AE team)</strong><br/>This field identifies how the issue is communicated to the costumer, the different entries are: <ul><li><em>Release notes visible</em>: issue is part of the release notes. This option is for release issue list only.</li><li><em>AE visible</em>: AEs know about the issue and will inform the customer if they report an issue. </li><li><em>On demand visible</em>: AEs will proactively inform customers whom they think will run into the issue.</li><li><em>Customer visible</em>: AEs will inform to all current and new costumers. This option is only for errata issue list. This option will trigger an Errata document release </li></ul></li><li><strong>Target Fix Date <strong>(owner AE team)</strong></strong><br/>Identifies the target fix date </li><li><strong>Target Fix version <strong>(owner AE team)</strong></strong><br/>Identifies the target fix version </li><li><strong>Fix Date <strong>(owner engineering team)</strong></strong><br/>Identifies the fix release date </li><li><strong>Fix Version <strong><strong>(owner engineering team)</strong></strong></strong><br/>Identifies the fix version </li></ul><p> </p><p>Before a release engineering  team will identify, tag and list all potential non fix issues on the release checklist page. Once both the teams agree; these issues will be added to the release issue list.</p><p>Issues that are found after the release will go through the similar process where they are initially added to the post release checklist. Once both the teams agree; these issues  will be added to the errata issue list. The visibility of the issue is determined with the agreement of both engineering and  AE team. Errata release may have single or multiple issues depending on the severity and the time frame they are discovered in. </p><p> </p><p> </p>
