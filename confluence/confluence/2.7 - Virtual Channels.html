<p>Virtual Channels allow multiple messages on different VCs to share the common physical channel. PHITs from different VCs are allowed to multiplex on to the same channel. However, PHITs belonging to different packets but from the same VC are not allowed to interleave. That is, once a multi-PHIT/FLIT packet transmission has started, no other packet from the same VC can be interleaved with the packet that has just started transmission.</p><p>Virtual Channels offer the following: </p><ol><li>Traffic isolation. That is, different traffic classes can be mapped to different VCs and by using appropriate scheduling algorithms in the ATU and Switch arbiters the Interconnect can guarantee bandwidth and delay.</li><li>Increase Interconnect throughput by reducing HoL. That is, by adding VCs we reduce Head-of-line blocking and allow forward progress on the VCs that are not blocked.</li><li>Deadlock avoidance. VCs can used to prevent deadlocks if a single network is used for both request and response messages.</li></ol><p>Symphony will support multiple flavors of VC implementations. In R1 release, Symphony will offer Flow-Through VC aware switches, buffered VC switches.  </p><p>Add dia to shows how VCs work</p>
