</p><ol start="1"><li><p>JS data extraction proved to be very time intensive. This was because the only way I can fully validate my bring-up was by using dmi &gt; 8 for the interleaving function values to be meaningful.

Found out that earlier scratchpad addresses were only a max of 32 bits and not using the whole width of the address, this was due to using $urandom_range, which is a 32 bit only randomizing function.

 </p><ol start="1"><li><p>Redesign effort to avoid coherent/non-coherent address space related native I/F errors.</p></li><li><p>Currently the scoreboard does a best effort lookup. It adds all the AXI transactions into a queue and tries to find them when a Fill or a DtrReq. This is not the best approach because the order in which the AXI transactions are sent out and the fill/dtr received don’t exactly match, this causes AXI match violations.</p></li><li><p>Wrote a new interface/agent/monitor to assert read order based on the read arbiter in RTL and resorting to order the received native I/F transactions based on the time when the transaction is processed at the arbiter.</p></li><li><p>Hit issues with environment compiling all DMI instances in config causing compile errors in instances not instantiated or used. Working with Balaji on this. </p></li><li><p>Bringing this up also flagged a DV compile efficiency issue where more than the utilized dmi instance is compiled adding overhead to compile time. </p></li><li><p>Once all configurations are compile clean, will run a regression and try to fine tune the scoreboarding behavior. </p></li></ol></li></ol><p />
