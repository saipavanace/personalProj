It's upto software to decide how these switches are connected.</li><li>Software needs to decide how all the register blocks are arranged in IP-XACT.</li><li>Config network ATUT only has APB interface but regular ATUT has both APB interface and interrupt interface.</li></ol><p><br/>Important Features and requirements:<br/>  1. No. of ATUT inside configuration network = No. of blocks that need configuration. Every ATUI, ATUT, PMON stats, PMON probe, Firewall, multicast, interrupt block will have 1 configuration network ATUT.<br/>  2. Switch size in config network is limited to 8x8, hence it’s upto software to decide the number of switches and combination of them based on number of symphony blocks that need configuration.<br/>  3. It’s upto software to decide how all blocks are arranged in IP-XACT.<br/>  4. For Release 1 we will have only 1 hidden ATUT that communicates with config network.<br/>  5. No APB demux required so that we can make it easier for software.<br/>  6. DV shouldn’t generate random data for hidden ATUT.<br/>  7. Config network ATUT will be of type APB.<br/>  8. Config network runs on the slowest clock in the system.<br/>  9. To help automate generation of tb.json through Aria for this, we propose the addition of following parameters in the gen_wrapper JSON: &quot;cfgTargetId&quot;: This will be a non-negative integers and will match the node-ID of the target (Green ATUT) that connects to the configuration network. Aria can then search in all the PAM tables to identify which ones have this node-ID marked as a target.<br/>  10.All system registers can only be programmed through configuration network.<br/><br/><br/></p>
