<p>Blocks in Symphony, can generate interrupts for a variety of reasons. Interrupts are level sensitive.</p><p>If a block is the source of more than one interrupt, there is only one interrupt wire coming out of a block, and so the block will have a register sitting in it's configuration space that can be read to determine which of the internal interrupts are firing.</p><p>Symphony provide blocks that allow interrupts to be accumulated in any manner, but for the initial release, only one interrupt signal will exit the top block. These grouping blocks have registers that are in the configuration space of Symphony and so can be read and written and used to clear interrupts.</p><p>Interrupt processing happens outside the confines of Symphony and Symphony provides no IP to perform this function.</p><p>When clearing an interrupt, the outside agent must clear the interrupts in a sequential manner, starting at the source of the interrupt and working through the accumulating blocks that ultimately pass an interrupt to the interrupt signal exiting the top block.</p>
