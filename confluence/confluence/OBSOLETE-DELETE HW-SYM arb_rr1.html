Last request to win has lowest priority on next cycle.</p><p>Next indicates to move to next state. Next has a constraint on it that it can never assert if there are no gnts (or therefor no requests.) The logic could be changed to ignore moving to the next state if there are no requests, but this adds logic that is just being duplicated on the outside in the next logic.</p><p>out_gnt indicates the winner of the arbitration and is one hot.</p><p>in_state and out_state are used to maintain state in an external register. in_state an out_state are one hot, but the most significant bit is inverted. This inversion means that an in_state of all 0s means in_req[0] has the highest priority.</p><p>in_state is the winner of the last go around and out_state is the winner of this go around, if next is asserted, otherwise it's just in_state.</p><p>At reset, in_req[0] has highest priority followed by the remaining bits in ascending order.</p><p>When a out_get[n] wins and next is asserted, then in_req[n] will have the lowest priority on the next cycle and in_req[n+1] will have the highest priority wrapping through 0.</p></div></div><p><br/></p>
