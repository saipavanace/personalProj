Needs to validate across the board on all the sheets</span></li><li><span>Created Json file to model the dependencies for DMI based on discussions and feedback from HW/RTL team</span></li><li><span>Next:</span></li><ul><li><span>Complete modeling of 1-2 Ncore units (based on RTL team data) + system-level inter-Ncore unit dependencies</span></li></ul></ul><li><strong><span>Dependency manager: Allan + Moez</span></strong></li><ul><li><span>Started integrating flow manager with dependency manager</span></li><li><span>Introduced a Tcl command for modeling a library model (including its parameters)</span></li><li><span>Started integrating the generated scripts obtained by Allan’s conversion script (see above)</span></li><li><span>Needed to make a few changes in the dependency manager APIs to handle copying model schema, uniquified unit parameters, etc. (with contribution from Dan)</span></li><li><span>Started having a working flow showing the incremental parametrization and derivation, and the integration with the “check_object” </span></li><li><span>Next:</span></li><ul><li><span>Fix all identified bugs; “report_dependencies … -type values”, function names in “create_dependency”</span></li><li><span>Complete processing of a sub-version of dry run #1 – Details of the demo to be defined and documented</span></li><li><span>Create a case where we need to use functionalities from ADM to resolve some of the dependencies</span></li></ul></ul><li><strong><span>Design verification: Allan + Moez</span></strong></li><ul><li><span>Next:</span></li><ul><li><span>Start some architecture and coding to capture DV team needs</span></li><li><span>Not mandatory to show working results, but it would be good to start some foundation</span></li></ul></ul></ul><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p>
