<p>Highlights:</p><ul><li>Fixed bugs found in generic_wrapper found by SW.</li><li>Presentation about Common Layer transformations and started a revision based on feedback.</li><li>UART Gasket - Released an AXI-APB configuration that connects the dii1 of the NXP config to a UART controller.</li><li>Triaged fails in silver_phase_two_edf config.</li><li>Triaged issues with Legato regressions</li></ul><ul><li>Fixed TACHL issues associated with bench creation.</li><li>Filed bug on DV for test bench issues.</li></ul><ul><li>Continued debugging a fixing RTL issues related to Bronze, Silver and Randomizer configurations.</li><li>DII related change: modified DTR block for Kjeld improving the error reporting for Narrow Unaligned Reads</li><li>Running zero-wire-load[ZWL] builds since synthesis on Sula is not possible.</li><li>Changing bucketizer to look at levels of logic. Need to use this while having to use ZWL analysis for timing fixes.</li></ul><p><br/></p><p>Lowlights:</p><ul><li>No progress on timing because of server issues. Timing changes based on ZWL runs are not ideal.</li></ul><p><br/></p><p><br/></p><p>Timing report:</p><p>ZWL run:</p><ul><ul><li>Ran atui and atut (bronze phase 3) from the prior week and compared it to a build from current (as of last week) top of tree</li><li>Atut meets timing (w/ZWL) but has several paths at 25+ levels of logic which will be a problem with wire delays</li><li>Atui had several bugs fixes but the comparison to the previous weeks showed only about 15ps additional delay to WNS</li></ul></ul><p><br/></p><p>Timing report from 2 weeks back[04/30/2021]:</p><ul><li><span> </span><span>Bronze Phase 1 ATUI paths at –24ps and ATUT paths at –30ps</span><span>​</span></li><li><span>Bronze Phase 2 ATUI paths at –52ps and ATUT paths at –38ps</span><span>​</span></li><li><span>Bronze Phase 3 ATUI paths at –38ps and ATUT paths at –137ps </span><span>​</span></li><li><span>Silver Phase 1 ATUI paths at –24ps and ATUT paths at –29ps</span><span>​</span></li><li><span> </span><span>4x4 ATUI paths at –328ps and ATUT paths at –529ps</span></li></ul><p><span> </span></p><p>---------------------------</p><p>DETAILED REPORTS</p><p>---------------------------</p><p>JOHN:</p><p>-------------------------</p><p>BOB:</p><p>-------------------------</p><p>ERIC:</p><p>-------------------------</p><p>TROY:</p><p><br/></p><p>-------------------------</p><p>JASON:</p><p><br/></p><p>-------------------------</p><p>DARSHAN:</p><p><br/></p><p>-------------------------</p><p><br/></p><p><br/></p><p><br/></p>
