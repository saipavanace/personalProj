Owners are shown in […]. This is initial assignment, can change.  </p><p>Notice that this goes beyond the five questions asked by Khaled. Please feel free to add things if I forgot anything.</p><ol><li><strong>Should we use 16nm?</strong><br/> No, we should move directly to 7. Eric prepared directory with 7nm libraries we can use<br/> Synthesis scripts hardcoded to 16, need to add capability to script generator to choose between 16 or 7 [Benny]</li><li><strong>Synthesis strategy: hierarchical vs. flat</strong><br/> Hierarchical bottom-up. For Ncore designs such as NXP, with replicated units we should modify the flow to avoid replications – i.e do characterize-compile-freeze. [Benny]</li><li><strong>Constraints: How do we plan to constrain the design? Timing constraints?</strong><br/> a. Clocks and basic IO – done<br/> b. Async clock domain crossing - starting [Boon, Benny]</li><li><strong>Memories: How are we planning to handle: Flops vs. SRAM Breaks into few options</strong></li></ol><p style="margin-left: 60.0px;">a. “Black hole” - simplest and dumbest, Verilog modules which should be implemented as hard macros are simply excluded from file list. done.<br/>b. Quick black boxing – see if we can create empty Verilog modules and annotate basic in-clk, clk-out timing arcs based on some heuristics. Or create simplistic .lib. Slightly better than black hole, but still very inaccurate<br/>Manual experiments [Boon] If approach found acceptable, automate [Benny]<br/>c. Run memory compiler. Very laborious, may not be practically possible if there are multiple memory configurations in the design [Boon]<br/>d. Look for ways to  force DC to synthesize flops more efficiently [Eric?]</p><p style="margin-left: 30.0px;"><strong>5. Division of labor: who does what? Who is owning the synthesis scripts?</strong></p><p style="margin-left: 60.0px;">We decided to go with Aria since it’s already capable to generate synthesis scripts for top and unit level. In terms of ownership:<br/>a. Timing constraints and all other things which are generated dynamically in Aria and are design specific – Benny<br/>b. Template synthesis scripts development dc.tcl, dc_setup.tcl – Boon &amp; Benny jointly<br/>c. Synthesis experiments – Boon, Tso-Wei, Eric</p><p style="margin-left: 30.0px;"><strong>6. Time line to meet our target date</strong></p><p style="margin-left: 60.0px;">Target dates which I propose are tentative. They’re contingent on availability of synthesizable RTL and surprises which we’ll likely discover<br/>a. Use smaller hw_config_two as a pipecleaner. All *internal_mem*.v will be “black holed” Nov 8<br/>b. hv_config_7 – NXP with one clock, “black hole” all mems, 0 WLM, relaxed constraints – synthesize Ncore units first, then top level. Nov 15<br/>c. hw_config_8  - same for multi-clock, requires async clock constraints. Nov 22<br/>d. Configs 7 and 8 with dc_topo parasitics and real constraints . Nov 29</p><p> </p>
