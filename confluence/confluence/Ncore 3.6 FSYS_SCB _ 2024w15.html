CONC-14221. Haven’t root caused it, but looks like a DV issue. The test is trying to generate a specific type of coherent txn and runs into an infinite loop trying to generate an address with a specific cache state. Such tests should ideally not fail as addr manager failures, but should be a test fail. For accurate debug efforts in future. </p></li><li><p>I am planning to look at all such timeout errors in addr manager functions. Such timeouts ideally shouldn’t be inside the function, timeouts should be added at the function invocation point in test case. This will be added as a subtask for addr manager improvement task. </p></li></ul><h2 id="Ncore3.6FSYS_SCB:2024w15-Activities:"><strong>Activities:</strong></h2>
