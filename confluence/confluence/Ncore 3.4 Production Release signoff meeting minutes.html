<p><strong>Meeting Date: </strong>5/1/2023 11:00 AM</p><h1 id="Ncore3.4ProductionReleasesignoffmeetingminutes-Notes">Notes</h1><p> </p><p>Hi all,</p><p>Thanks for attending the Ncore 3.4 production release pre-signoff meeting to review the product status <br/>to confirm there is no gating item for the product to be released to the customers and the QA is successful. <br/>The supporting data are available in the Ncore 3.4 <a href="https://arterisip.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/ENGR/pages/190316558/Ncore+3.4+production+release+checklist" data-linked-resource-id="190316558" data-linked-resource-version="25" data-linked-resource-type="page">checklist</a>.<br/>See below the notes I have taken and the action items captured during the meeting.</p><p> </p><p>The engineering team has completed all the Ncore 3.4 signoff activities back in early April and created a <br/>1<sup>st</sup> build to verify the product while the QA was run in parallel.</p><p>2 additional builds have been created (to fix a deadlock issue in Maestro, RTL issues found during regressions and Customer Test Benches issues found during QA).</p><p>An initial review  to go through all the signoff data has been held April-6<sup>th</sup> and the action items from that<br/>meeting have been closed in the meantime.</p><p> </p><p><strong>RTL signoff status:</strong></p><p><u>Lint results:</u></p><p>Low number of Errors (~10) are waivable. The fixes are too risky and not implemented.</p><p>List of waivers is provided.</p><p><u>RTL open JIRA tickets:</u></p><p>No open RTL bug while one issue is opened to update the architecture specification to match the RTL behavior which is correct

.</p><p><u>Timing analysis:</u></p><p>DC-NXT run completed for the HW-Config10-Lite and the signoff checklist has been updates with the results. 3 large timing violations have been discussed.</p><ul><li><p>chi_async_adapter_a: violation is due to missing constraint in Maestro script (false paths between the 2 clock domains). Issue has been solved
