<p>A rate adapter is a unidirectional adapters that sits between two ATP links that run off different clocks and the ATP link's clock entering the block is slower than the ATP link's clock exiting the block. The purpose of the rate adapter is to eliminate bubbles in a packet on the fast side of the adapter.</p><h4 id="id-3.4.4-Rate-Parameters">Parameters</h4><p><strong>ratio</strong>: [I,J]</p><p>I is the frequency equivalent of the in clock</p><p>J is the frequency equivalent of the out clock</p><p><strong>depth</strong>: number of beats of the average packet expected to cross the boundary. </p>
