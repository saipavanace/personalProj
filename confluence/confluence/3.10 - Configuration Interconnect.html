<h1 id="id-3.10-ConfigurationInterconnect-3.10.1TheHardwareView">3.10.1 The Hardware View</h1><p>Any read/write registers are in configuration space and hang off their own specially dedicated interconnect. Consider the simple network below:</p><p><span class="confluence-embedded-file-wrapper"><img class="confluence-embedded-image" src="https://arterisip.atlassian.net/wiki/download/attachments/16169580/FullNetworkNoCfg.svg?api=v2"></span></p><p>The links and blocks colored in blue represent the request fabric, the links and blocks colored in red represent the response fabric, the blocks colored in black represent blocks that sit in both fabrics, and the links and the blocks and links colored in green represent the PMON interconnect. The interrupts have been left out to simplify the diagram.</p><p>Below is the block diagram of the above when we include the configuration network. As we can see, one of the target ATUs in the above block diagram was actually the target for the configuration network. The config target blocks are APB target ATUs.</p><p><span class="confluence-embedded-file-wrapper"><img class="confluence-embedded-image" src="https://arterisip.atlassian.net/wiki/download/attachments/16169580/FullNetwork.svg?api=v2"></span></p><p>The added network is configured such that it uses the least amount of wires and gates as possible, and so is not high performing for either latency or bandwidth. The packet style will be fixed with a data width as narrow possible and the number of outstanding transactions will be low.</p><p>The target ATU that heads the configuration network is the ATU that contains part of the address map of the entire configuration network as a part of their PAM (Partial Address Map) tables. The remaining part is contained in the config target's apbSlvLut (APB Slave Look up Table.) </p><p>In Maestro the user will have set aside a range of addresses for configuration in the global address map. Maestro will then automatically position all the configuration registers in that space and export an address map and description of the registers in the form of an IP-XACT file. If the range is not wide enough, Maestro will report such and require a modification to the global address map.</p><p> </p>
