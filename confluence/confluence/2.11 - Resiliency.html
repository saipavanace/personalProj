<p>Resiliency, broadly speaking, are the set of tools that Symphony uses to catch transient or permanent faults that occur in a part since being manufacturered and passing screening. They fall into two broad categories:</p><ol><li>Unit Duplication</li><li>Encoding of state (ECC and parity being examples)</li></ol><p>For unit duplication, the blocks are logically duplicated, inputs are applied equally to both blocks and the output from the block are compared to see if they are the same. The blocks may be functionally separated in either time, space or both. Care is taken to remove as many single points of failure as possible (For example, the use of two clocks that are synchronous to each other but don't share resources, like wires and gates.)</p><p>Encoding of state covers internal registers of a block, the contents of a packet, the contents of an SRAM and the values of the signals on an interface on a per cycle basis.</p><p>When errors are detected, they are reported as quickly as possible to the Fault Processor and various parts of the Fault Processor and error circuitry can be scrubbed for latent faults during normal function. During the time of latent fault scrubbing, the part is running in a reduced reliable mode, but amount of scrubbing performed is calculated such that it has a small effect on the over all reliability of a product.</p><p>In a resilient system any logic function is covered by one of the two mechanisms described above. When converting from from state encoding method to another, the block doing the converting is duplicated.</p><p>Errors reported in the resiliency infra structure follow a parallel path to the interrupt infra structure to be talk about later.</p><p>Note: Resiliency is not part of the R1 release of Symphony. </p><p>Add a picture...</p><p>Per Syed on 11/26, the Resiliency chapter might not be included in the final release of the book.  </p><p> </p><p>{</p>
