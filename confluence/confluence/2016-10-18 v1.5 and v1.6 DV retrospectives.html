That came out with hashtag implementation. Less amount of feedback/review for DV. (P1)</li><li>No latency/throughput requirement defined up front. That caused some more churn. (P1)</li><li>Test planning did not go well. Hash tags solved some of this, but we need multiple test plan reviews and we should update test plans as soon as holes are discovered in the TB. Holes/missing test functions did not get accounted for in schedule. (P1)</li><li>Hash tags should have percentage done tracking and how much effort they will take. (P3)</li><li>Cherry picking because multiple projects are being done in parallel. Pre-push should only run on a check-in that has been published. Come up with a way of formally doing cherry-picking (maybe always check-in into multiple branches when making a change instead of doing it on one branch first and another branch later) (P2)</li><li>Be clear with where a hash tag comes from and what its scope is more precisely. (P2)</li><li>No gap between RTL freeze and DV closure. (P1)</li><li>Software codegen had a lot of issues and that delayed system hw. Very difficult to debug codegen failures. Rolling back codegen is not an option. Codegen should go through hw release mechanism so that dv/hw should not face any issues. Possibly bring back bamboo for codegen updates (maybe just a small set of tests). Once codegen is changed, an automated script should update refresh_hw/setup_hw scripts. (P1)</li><li>Error/transport errors should be done in hw while writing RTL features instead of the end. Wont be able to verify errors/csrs if all these features are coded at the end of a project. RTL feature complete should be a lot earlier than project release date. (P1)</li><li><span>RTL feature complete date should be a lot earlier than release date. No time for DV to finish up if there is not enough time at the end. Add milestones. (P1)</span></li><li><span><span>CSR tests and errors in v1.5 was not complete, causing lots of bugs to be found in v1.6. Didnt enough time/framework to get things done in v1.5. Common framework missing in places where they can be used (for ex: pressure implementation) (P1)</span></span></li><li>Schedule should include last minute timing and last minute bug fixes. Projects are getting delayed because these issues are not being taken into account up front. Risk assessment should be done on these last minute changes to gauge how much schedule will slip due to them. (P1)<span><span><br/></span></span></li><li>Duplication of work because multiple projects with release dates close to each other. Come up with a regular cadence. So that we dont have to run coverage and customer TB so often. (P1)</li><li>For every release, there could be features that could be left out if the feature is not complete. So we don't miss a release cadence. (P1)</li><li>Managers should not have so many IC tasks on themselves. Focus will then be on tasks and not on schedule tracking. (P2)</li><li><span>Hiring and attrition. (P1)</span></li><li>Mon/Thu meetings should be more issue focused (Are you stuck on something? v/s Where are you on each task?). Maybe use one meeting for schedule updates and the other to unblock people and figure out issues that are coming up.
