One or more of the specific goals of the process area are not satisfied and no generic goals exist for this level since there is no reason to institutionalize a partially performed process. </span><span>(CMMI for Development, Version 1.3, p 24)</span></span></p><p><span>Level 1: Performed:</span></p><p><span><span>A performed process is a process that accomplishes the needed work to produce work products; the specific goals of the process area are satisfied. Although capability level 1 results in important improvements, those improvements can be lost over time if they are not institutionalized. </span><span>(CMMI for Development, Version 1.3, p 24)</span></span></p><p><span>Level 2: Managed:</span></p><p><span><span>A managed process is a performed process that is planned and executed in accordance with policy; employs skilled people having adequate resources to produce controlled outputs; involves relevant stakeholders; is monitored, controlled, and reviewed; and is evaluated for adherence to its process description. (CMMI for Development, Version 1.3, p 25)</span></span></p><p>Level 3: Defined:</p><p>A defined process is a managed process that is tailored from the organization’s set of standard processes according to the organization’s tailoring guidelines; has a maintained process description; and contributes process related experiences to the organizational process assets.
