<p>From Darsh:</p><p>Based on the parameter nTraceRegisters, which register can have multiple instances, or which will always have just one?</p><p>These all can have multiple instances based on nTraceRegisters.<br/>TBALR<br/>TBAHR<br/>TOPCR<br/>TUBR<br/>TUMBR</p><p>TCTLR. This one is confusing. It means you can have one of the four registers sets specify that you want Ncore-initiated trace, and another specifying master-initiated trace.</p><p><br/></p><p><br/></p><p><span class="legacy-color-text-blue3">How do we put TD (Trace &amp; Debug) in the most quiescent state possible?</span></p><p><span class="legacy-color-text-blue3">from Jason: </span></p><p><span class="legacy-color-text-blue3">The default state is set to not trigger on anything.</span></p><p><span class="legacy-color-text-blue3">Master initiated trace default is to ignore trigger bit on interface.</span></p><p><span class="legacy-color-text-blue3">NCore initiated trace default is to never trigger.</span></p><p><span class="legacy-color-text-blue3">When there are no triggers, there is no trace capture and no trace accumulation.</span></p>
