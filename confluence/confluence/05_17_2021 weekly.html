Tooks notes and made edits based on feedback.</li><li>Continued to send some jiras(some blockers) to either Bob or Darshan for triage/investigation. If issues are not blockers and not WRAP transaction related, sending them for triaging.</li><li>Timing is still priority but focused on debugging and jiras since we had issues with the synthesis server sula.</li><li>Worked on active jiras:</li><ul><li>SYM-5809: firewall issue and read data interleaving fix.</li><li>SYM-5639: debugged as DV issue.</li><li>SYM-5845: another firewall issue debugged and sent to eric since within initiator.</li><li>SYM-5860: debugged to be issue in initiator regarding splitting, sent to Eric to fix</li><li>SYM-5866: DV query over compressed IDs</li><li>SYM-5783: blocker issue with new config by Sai.

This was a tricky and took longer than I wanted to. It involved how error response was being interjected into response path. Needed to account for various combinations/state of response processing. Having header but no data, having data but no header, etc. Worked on solution and resolved successfully.</li><li>Performance test questions and discussions with Kavish.</li></ul></ul><p>This week I will focus on.</p><ul><li>ATUT timing for bronze &amp; large 4x4!</li><li>Continual high priority firewall or randomizer jira maintenance.</li><li>WRAP corner case translation updates.</li></ul><p><br/></p><p>-------------------------</p><p>DARSHAN:</p><ul><li>Been busy mostly with bugs related to:</li><ul><li>Interrupt-infrastructure.</li><li>Firewall interrupt register</li><li>Serial-to-fixed header cycle adaption</li></ul></ul><p><br/></p><p>-------------------------</p><p><br/></p><p><br/></p><p><br/></p>
