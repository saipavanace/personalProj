<h2 id="amba_chl_protection-Parameters">Parameters</h2><h3 id="amba_chl_protection-JavaScript">JavaScript</h3><p><em><strong>checkType</strong></em>: A string that takes the following values: “NONE”, “ODD_PARITY_BYTE_ALL”. If checkType is anything other than “NONE”, then input *_chk signals are used for checking parity on the incoming functional signals in the AMBA interface (specified by the direction), and output *_chk signals are used to drive the parity computed on outgoing functional signals of the same interface. This param must be set to “NONE”, if the AMBA interface doesn’t include any parity checking *_chk signals.</p><p><em><strong>direction</strong></em>: A string that takes the following values: “slave”, “master”. If direction is “slave”, *_chk signals on the slave AMBA interface (inInterface) are used for Parity checking, otherwise the *_chk signals on the master AMBA interface (outInterface) are used instead. For Ncore AIUs this is always set to “slave”.</p><p><em><strong>checkEnables</strong></em>: A JavaScript object of strings (names) that specifies the qualifier or enable for parity checks on functional signals in the incoming channel’s signal bundle. It has the following structure:<br/>{<br/>  “func_signal_0”: “enable_for_func_signal_0”,<br/>  “func_signal_1”: “enable_for_func_signal_1”,<br/>    .<br/>    .<br/>    .<br/>}</p><p>When no enable is specified for a functional signal, the enable defaults to ‘1’b1’ meaning the check on that signal is always enabled.</p><h2 id="amba_chl_protection-Interfaces">Interfaces</h2><p><em><strong>inInterface</strong></em>: Any slave AMBA interface (*old-style) that supports Interface parity checking. The “<em>signals</em>” bundle may or may not include any *_chk signals. In the latter case, the <em>checkType</em> parameter must be “NONE”.</p><p><em><strong>outInterface</strong></em>: Any master AMBA interface (*old-style) that supports Interface parity checking. The “<em>signals</em>” bundle may or may not include any *_chk signals. In the latter case, the <em>checkType</em> parameter must be “NONE”.</p><p> </p><p>*Old-style interface here means that it is a JavaScript object with the following properties: <br/>{<br/>name: A string,<br/>signals: A signal bundle object. This is typically an object of signal widths (integer) accessed with signal names as keys. But it is also allowed to be hierarchical: i.e. it can be an object of other signal bundles accessed with channel names as keys.<br/>}</p><p> </p><h2 id="amba_chl_protection-Modulesused">Modules used</h2><p><a href="https://arterisip.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/ENGR/pages/16155739/logic+tree" rel="nofollow">logic_tree</a></p><p>par_enc</p><p> </p><h2 id="amba_chl_protection-Description">Description</h2><p>The block performs two main functions when <em>checkType</em> === “ODD_PARITY_BYTE_ALL”:</p><ol start="1"><li><p>It checks for odd parity of every incoming functional signal’s bits with its corresponding check signal on the AMBA interface (specified by direction).</p></li><li><p>It computes odd parity bit(s) for every outgoing functional signal and drives the same on the corresponding check signal of the AMBA interface (specified by direction).</p></li></ol><p>The block always passes through all the functional signals from the master AMBA interface ( <em>outinterface </em>) to the slave AMBA interface ( <em>inInterface </em>) regardless of the value of <em>checkType</em>.</p><p>When <em>checkType</em> === “NONE”, the block simply passes through all the signals of the interface from the master to the slave interface.</p>
