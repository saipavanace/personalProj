<p>Symphony has two Power Management Blocks, the PMA Slave (PMA_S) and PMA Master (PMA_M). The diagram below shows an example Symphony controlled by a Q Channel Interface.</p><p><span class="confluence-embedded-file-wrapper image-center-wrapper confluence-embedded-manual-size"><img class="confluence-embedded-image image-center" width="600" src="https://arterisip.atlassian.net/wiki/download/attachments/16169564/image2019-10-30%2010:7:9.png?api=v2"></span></p><h3 id="id-3.6-PowerManagementBlocks-PMASlave(PMA_S)">PMA Slave (PMA_S)</h3><p>The PMA Slave controls the power state of a single Symphony block. The PMA Slave takes in a single Q or P Channel Interface and interfaces with the block to set it to a sleep state, or wake it up out of a sleep state.</p><p>The PMA Slave can be configured in the following ways:</p><ol><li style="list-style-type: none;background-image: none;"><ol><li>Q or P Channel Interface</li><li>A configurable timeout value where the PMA will deny a request after a certain amount of clock cycles.</li><li>A configurable abort where the PMA will immediately deny any power-down request based on a specific Symphony block state.</li></ol></li></ol><h3 id="id-3.6-PowerManagementBlocks-PMAMaster(PMA_M)">PMA Master (PMA_M)</h3><p>The PMA Master takes in multiple Q and P Channel interfaces from PMA Slaves and aggregates them into a single Q or P Channel Interface. The PMA Master will only accept a power-down request if all slaves accept the power-down request. If one slave denys the power down request the PMA Master will cancel the power-down request to each of the other slaves</p><p>The PMA Master can be configured in the following ways:</p><ol><li style="list-style-type: none;background-image: none;"><ol><li>Q or P Channel Interface on the Master side</li></ol></li></ol><h3 id="id-3.6-PowerManagementBlocks-PMU">PMU</h3><p>The power management unit which sits outside the context of Symphony. This block controls the power state of each domain through a P or Q interface.</p>
