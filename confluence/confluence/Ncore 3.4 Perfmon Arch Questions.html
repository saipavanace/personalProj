<p>Questions that came up during the microarchitecture review on Apr 4, 2022:</p><ol><li>Are we going to miss any events (Boon) during BW measurement? No. Because we don’t really synchronize events to a slower clock. One of the two 32-bit counters that counts BW events will still count every event. The other counter simply counts every 16<sup>th</sup></li><li>Overflow bits: When overflow occurs, is there an indication that overflow occurred? Yes, there is an overflow bit. However currently there is only a single overflow bit. We might need an overflow bit on a per 32-bit counter basis.</li><li>Is Latency binning supported for STT table entries (Boon)? Answer from Khaleel: No. Only read and write transaction latencies are supported.</li><li>Is the interrupt level and set until it’s cleared? Is this okay if its of lower priority considering the time it might take for software to clear it? (Chien)</li><li>How can DV predict which transactions were allocated into the Latency counter table (Eric) ? They might need to tap into some internal signals.</li></ol>
