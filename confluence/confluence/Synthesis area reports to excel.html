Else, ensure that you have at least Node version 8. The script uses an ‘xlsx’ package that can be installed with the command below:</p><p>npm install xlsx</p><p /><p>Description</p><p>The script parses synthesis area reports for area and other (flop) numbers and instance paths in a design and writes them into an output excel. The excel prints the numbers for leaf instances of the design only and provides a way of specifying them through a JSON object. </p><p>The script requires the following inputs:</p><ol start="1"><li><p>Top Module (-t) : Top Verilog module name for which area numbers of all its design instances (leaf-only) are generated.</p></li><li><p>Synthesis Area Report Path (-i) : Path where the area reports exist including that of the top module as well as all that of all the design instances inside it.</p></li><li><p>Leaf Design Info (-j): This is a JSON file that provides details of which instances can be treated as leaf instances or modules can be treated as instances. For leaf blocks, the excel prints a single row and area number for the whole block and skips the numbers of all instances inside it. This is a design specific file.</p></li><li><p>Output Excel (-o): The name of the output excel file.</p></li></ol><p /><p>Ex:</p><p>cd $WORK_TOP/../hw-lib/js/synthesis_area_rpt_to_xl<br/><br/>./synthesis_area_rpt_to_xl.js -i /scratch/boon/ZWLM/reports -j dce_leaf_design_info.json -t dce_unit_a -o ~/spreadsheets/Synthesis_Report.xlsx</p><p>The above command is for running the script on DCE synthesis area reports.</p>
