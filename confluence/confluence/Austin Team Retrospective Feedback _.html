Multiple owners on a single block will work as a team, filling in for each other when one is on leave/vacation. Co-owners of a block should communicate and try to avoid a situation where none of them are available, so the project progress is not stalled.</span></li><li><span>I like the idea of block owners implementing all the features (ex: sysco) in the block, and updating the block testplan with the checks/coverage implemented related to the feature, instead of having a feature owner, trying to implement the feature in all the blocks. Since the feature owner is not knowledgeable about the testbench code, he would have to work with block owner nevertheless. On the other hand if the block owner learns and understand the spec about a particular feature, he can independently code the testbench checks for it/work on coverage. But if the checks for a feature can be implemented completely in a different package, (eg: trace &amp; debug) then probably having a feature owner makes more sense.&nbsp;</span></li><li><span>I think it would really help if the regression report failing signatures can have a Jira number in the next column. Basically somehow link some text in the failing signature to a Jira. So if we see new signature, with no associated Jira, we know they are new and have not been assigned to anyone to look at. &nbsp;This also helps to avoid filing duplicate Jira, and avoid multiple people debug the same failing signature.&nbsp;</span></li><li><span>Monthly/quarterly feedback about each individual&rsquo;s work, by manager and team lead, and suggest areas to improvise encourages and motivates them to do better. Recognizing and awarding deserving employees makes them feel appreciated and worthy. That will in turn reflect in their future contribution to project success. I find a streamlined performance rating process missing in this company (something I have seen in Intel &amp; Qualcomm) To make it easy for manager/team leads, &nbsp;every team member can track what progress they make and submit a weekly/monthly/quarterly report.</span></li></ol></td></tr><tr><td class="numberingColumn confluenceTd">3</td><td class="confluenceTd"><div class="content-wrapper"><a class="confluence-userlink user-mention" data-account-id="624b36eb45ece00069cca831" href="https://arterisip.atlassian.net/wiki/people/624b36eb45ece00069cca831?ref=confluence" target="_blank" data-linked-resource-id="786785" data-linked-resource-version="1" data-linked-resource-type="userinfo" data-base-url="https://arterisip.atlassian.net/wiki">Kavish Shah</a></div></td><td class="confluenceTd"><ol><li><span>DV flow chart for the scoreboard (especially ioaiu scoreboard) it&rsquo;s super tought with different flow</span></li><li><span>Compulsory commenting for if &ndash; else conditions in the scoreboard (super hard to understand if conditions with 20 variables)</span></li><li><span>Port qrsim capabailities to runsim for easy re-run and splitting the processes</span></li><li><span>Block level testlplan have a flow to read documentation as well -&gt; For IOAIU you need AXi, ACE, CCMP, CCP, Sysco etc documentation</span></li></ol></td></tr><tr><td class="numberingColumn confluenceTd">4</td><td class="confluenceTd"><div class="content-wrapper"><a class="confluence-userlink user-mention" data-account-id="624b378f699649006ae98ff1" href="https://arterisip.atlassian.net/wiki/people/624b378f699649006ae98ff1?ref=confluence" target="_blank" data-linked-resource-id="789132" data-linked-resource-version="1" data-linked-resource-type="userinfo" data-base-url="https://arterisip.atlassian.net/wiki">Naveen Rajagopal</a></div></td><td class="confluenceTd"><ol><li><span>Block level environments must be following a uniform structure to make it scalable / portable at fullsys level.</span></li><li><span>Formal trainings on the standard protocols would help debug and work more efficiently.</span></li><li><span>Listing the names of tests failing with similar signature rather than the total tests failing number would help pick the shortest running test / config at fullsys to help save the runtime.</span></li><li><span>UVM_ERROR messages are very generic and the more useful information about the packet fields of interest was visually picked scrolling through the logs.

Especially, if we must fix a failing test within a limited amount of time and without much familiarity with what the code is expected to do(scoreboard in particular)</span></li><li><span>The way we do it right now is by focusing on piece of code that is causing the failure (ignoring the bigger picture) and write a bandage code which would fix that issue. However, this will make the code fragile, and time saved here is spent debugging another issue that is caused due to the earlier fix.</span></li><li><span>This issue will be mitigated as the engineer understands the code better with time and later will be able to make more robust fixes. But the cycle will be reset when he/she leaves the company or moves to a different assignment unless we&nbsp;</span><span>document the code</span><span>.</span></li><li><span>As a bonus, a well structed code will go a long way I feel but right now I have no idea on how to enforce it</span></li></ol><li><span>A Golden Document from the design team:</span><ol><li><span>An example: There was an &ldquo;enable&rdquo; register that I encountered during the SysReq which had a default value of &lsquo;1&rsquo; (that is enabled by default) and hence to do the verification I did not have to specifically enable this register</span></li><li><span>But at some point, in the middle of the verification effort, this value was changed to &lsquo;0&rsquo;. So, all the tests started passing because the feature itself was disabled. Fortunately, in this case, the change was communicated through an email and hence we were able to react to that, but we might as well lose track of the emails and slip a bug (or multiple bugs) related to this feature.&nbsp;</span></li><li><span>We can (or need to) have a sign off mechanism for these design changes</span></li></ol></li><ol><li><span>Other problem I faced was there is no single source (or a set of multiple sources) of information that we can refer to before we plan our verification</span></li><li><span>Often, we had to talk to the designer to understand a scenario and the designer redirected us to the architecture team to get the information. Few times, the information was then added (or the document modified) after the original concern was raised</span></li><li><span>A some point we should find a robust document that does not change (excluding cases where the document must be modified to address bugs that are found)</span></li><li><span>In case there are any design changes to this document, it should be properly communicated (in a way that is trackable).</span></li></ol><li><span>Design Requirements Specification:</span></li><ol><li><span>This is in relation to the above point where the designer can make the spec more modular by extracting the design requirements from the intended behavior of the design</span></li><li><span>We as a verification team, would consume each design requirement quite literally without leaving any room for interpretation or assumptions</span></li><li><span>I remember that there is an IEEE standard to guide us on creating requirements specification which we can refer to if we want to implement this</span></li></ol><li><span>Functional Coverage Coding:</span></li><ol><li><span>It is easy to plan for functional coverage at the very beginning of the feature verification rather than doing it towards the end</span></li><li><span>Even if the original owner of the feature did not change, to be sure that we did not miss any scenario, it is better to have the planned functional coverage at the very beginning when the thoughts are still fresh in our head rather than revisiting it later</span></li><li><span>The functional coverage must be a part of the Test plan review</span></li><li><span>In IOAIU, I had to define the functional coverage from scratch which is proving to be really hard.</span></li><li><span>P.S: We don&rsquo;t have to code functional coverage at the beginning if we properly document the planned coverage. Later we can revisit this document while coding and just let our fingers do the work without thinking much about it.</span></li></ol><li><span>Checkin Regression:</span></li><ol><li><span>As we keep verifying features and adding test cases, I think we need to periodically review the checkin regression to make it more robust and efficient at the same time</span></li><li><span>There were multiple scenarios in the recent past where an RTL/DV changes that caused lot of tests to fail wasn&rsquo;t caught in the checkin regression and this just stole significant amount of time from both design and verification&nbsp;</span></li><li><span>We can blindly pick up the failing test and add to checkin regression but that would only make the checkin regression slower over time. So, this must be reviewed often and more formally.</span></li></ol><li><span>Collective knowledge base:</span></li><ol><li><span style="color: black;">This is just an idea to make us more efficient. Many times, I encountered minor issues which are unfamiliar to me, that would eat up a lot of time debugging.&nbsp;</span><span data-colorid="dpqup20nuv">Sometimes, I would talk to a team member, and I realize that the issue was already familiar to him/her and I would have saved my debug time, had I known earlier.</span></li><li><span>The first person who encounters these issues can log them in a common database and others who looks at it later could just query against this database to get quick answers before spending time debugging.</span></li><li><span>This is like our private, company specific, Q&amp;A forum like stack overflow (but not accessible to outside world). There are multiple providers for these kinds of tools with very small fee</span></li><li><span>Example questions: &ldquo;Do ACE snoop Channels have ID fields?&rdquo;, &ldquo;What is heartbeat failure?&rdquo; etc</span></li><li><span>We currently get answers to these kind questions by sending an email to entire team or personally sending a message to a team member, but these methods are not searchable by others</span></li><li><span>This is especially useful as we are increasing the size of the database</span></li></ol><li><span>Reduce the use of plusargs?</span></li><ol><li><span>This might be an ignorant question, or it might be too late to change it now, but I feel adding plusargs is slowly decreasing the maintainability of our code as we keep adding more and more of them</span></li><li><span>The way I see plusargs are as incisions into our code base which would decrease the modularity and maintainability. Also, since plusargs are system calls that are forwarded to the Operating System, my guess is that these slow down our regressions especially because we have 1000&rsquo;s of tests with 100&rsquo;s of plusargs everywhere.</span></li><li><span>This also is making the code hard to understand</span></li><li><span>But I don&rsquo;t have strong opinion on this, but it is a good thing to discuss</span></li></ol></ol></td></tr><tr><td class="numberingColumn confluenceTd">6</td><td colspan="1" class="confluenceTd"><div class="content-wrapper"><a class="confluence-userlink user-mention" data-account-id="5ed63c82037d930c16bd8c73" href="https://arterisip.atlassian.net/wiki/people/5ed63c82037d930c16bd8c73?ref=confluence" target="_blank" data-linked-resource-id="327834" data-linked-resource-version="1" data-linked-resource-type="userinfo" data-base-url="https://arterisip.atlassian.net/wiki">Saad Zahid</a></div></td><td colspan="1" class="confluenceTd"><ul><ol><li><span>Check-in (push-test) regression clean-up.</span></li><li><span>Block level checkin regression.</span></li><li><span>Signature enhancements (duplicates, more details).</span></li><li><span>Register access in each Ncore FSYS scoreboard using RAL.</span></li><li><span>Legato scoreboard enable in regression.</span></li><li><span>FSYS End2End scoreboard.</span></li><li><span>Heartbeat failure debugging details.</span></li><li><span>Parameter coverage analysis and closure.</span></li><li><span>Synopsys VIP regression.</span></li><li><span>VCS simulator integration.</span></li></ol></ul></td></tr><tr><td class="numberingColumn confluenceTd">7</td><td colspan="1" class="confluenceTd"><br /></td><td colspan="1" class="confluenceTd"><br /></td></tr><tr><td class="numberingColumn confluenceTd">8</td><td colspan="1" class="confluenceTd"><br /></td><td colspan="1" class="confluenceTd"><br /></td></tr></tbody></table></div>
