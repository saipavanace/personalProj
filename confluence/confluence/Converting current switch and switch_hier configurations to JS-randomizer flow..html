<p>Below are the steps to convert existing switch and switch_hier configurations in Symphony regression list to JS randomizer flow.</p><p>1.To convert any topology to JS flow, there is a list of files which needs to be created.</p><ul><li>param.json - this is the constraint file which include any constraints on parameters related to the topologies, also can include any constraint which otherwise causes and rtl or bench issues</li><li>top.json.tachl - which lists the sequence of files to be resolved and processed by the tool.</li><li>top_tb_wrapper.json.tachl - this is the top level tb wrapper json file which needs to be built based on the topology.This generally include calls to output various parameters based on the randomization</li><li>top_wrapper.json.tachl - this is the top level rtl wrapper file which build the rtl underneath.</li></ul><p style="margin-left: 30.0px;">Examples for the above files can be found at $WORK_TOP/js_randomizer/switch_dw_rand ( params_hier.json,top.json.tachl,top_tb_wrapper.json.tachl,top_wrapper.json.tachl)</p><p>2. Here are the snapshots of how the changes look  in both tb and top wrappers when converting to JS randomizer flow. Example also show the convertion of old to new interface.</p><p><span class="confluence-embedded-file-wrapper"><img class="confluence-embedded-image" src="https://arterisip.atlassian.net/wiki/download/attachments/16166927/image2019-2-24%2011:11:20.png?api=v2"></span></p><p> </p><p><span class="confluence-embedded-file-wrapper"><img class="confluence-embedded-image" src="https://arterisip.atlassian.net/wiki/download/attachments/16166927/image2019-2-24%2011:12:9.png?api=v2"></span></p><p>3. A new instance for clock is added and the corresponding connections are made in an assign block in the tb_top_wrapper.json.tachl.</p><p><span class="confluence-embedded-file-wrapper confluence-embedded-manual-size"><img class="confluence-embedded-image" height="250" src="https://arterisip.atlassian.net/wiki/download/attachments/16166927/image2019-2-24%2011:13:37.png?api=v2"></span></p><p>4.Add the corresponding test in the testlist as below. Note the genfile is given as the top_tb_wrapper.json which is the name of the generated files to be used as the top JSON file before running the test.</p><blockquote><pre>Comment from Kavish : No need to provide &quot;opdir&quot; in the testlist, runsim takes care of the auto generated output directory inside debug directory hierarchy.</pre></blockquote><p><span class="confluence-embedded-file-wrapper"><img class="confluence-embedded-image" src="https://arterisip.atlassian.net/wiki/download/attachments/16166927/image2019-2-24%2011:14:57.png?api=v2"></span></p><p>Thanks,</p><p>Chandra.</p>
