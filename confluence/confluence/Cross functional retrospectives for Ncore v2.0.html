This causes a lot of code coverage work and potentially can save area as well.</li><li><strong>Code coverage could be pushed to RTL team and be done earlier so that the RTL team can make changes. Its done really late today after RTL freeze and so RTL improvements cannot be pushed in. Potentially move ownership and delivery of code coverage completely to the design team</strong>.</li><li>Micro architecture spec should be up to date and should give verification a good visual representation of the design so we know how the design is done.</li><li>Spec changes need to be documented religiously so that we know what has changed. Verification needs to be involved in micro architecture reviews and needs to be updated regularly so that all changes in RTL are documented.<br/><br/><br/><br/></li></ul><h2 id="CrossfunctionalretrospectivesforNcorev2.0-RTL">RTL</h2><ul><li><strong>Lint license issues, we should track licenses more efficiently</strong></li><li><strong>Performance testing was done too late, we should do this lot more earlier in the project.</strong><ul><li><strong>Should be part of pre push (Latency &amp; BW)</strong></li></ul></li><li>More constrained directed test early on</li><li><strong>block level Easter egg ??? &lt;- lint errors early</strong></li><li>Error and CSR testing is done way too late in the game. should figure out a way to do this earlier</li><li>DV and RTL should work in lock step</li></ul><p> </p><p>We want to follow up on the bolded ones above.</p><p> </p>
