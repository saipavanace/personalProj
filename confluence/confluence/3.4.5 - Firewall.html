<p>The firewall adapter is a unidirectional adapter that poisons a packet based on customer defined criteria. The customer definition comes in the form of a verilog module and a register description. Below is a block diagram. </p><p><span class="confluence-embedded-file-wrapper"><img class="confluence-embedded-image" src="https://arterisip.atlassian.net/wiki/download/attachments/16169608/fireWall.svg?api=v2"></span></p><p>The user defined verilog can have registers in it and customer needs to supply a register description (presently in the form of a JSON file formal called CSR which should eventually move to an IP-XACT description.</p><p>The envisioned flow is:</p><ol><li>Customer configures block and generates verilog.</li><li>Customer edits the User Defined Verilog block generated to implement the verilog code that generates the error</li><li>Customer uses edit version of the User Defined Verilog block to simulate and synthesize with.</li></ol><p>The advantage of the customer using the User Defined Verilog block initially generated by Maestro is the registers are fully implemented based on the incoming description.</p><h4 id="id-3.4.5-Firewall-Parameters">Parameters</h4><p><strong>simplePipe:</strong> true or false</p><p>The pipelining in the ATP depack block use simplePipe style vs. FIFO style.</p><p><strong>addStage</strong>: true or false</p><p>Based on the fields the customer needs to create his error, the ATP depack block may need to add in pipe stages or not. addStage = true forces the fields provided from the packet to their logic to always come from a register inside of ATP depack.</p><p><strong>udvFieldArray</strong>: [array or strings]</p><p>There are a list of fields available from the packet for the customer to use to generate the error. Examples are address, target ID, source ID and so on. This is the list of fields the customer needs to generate the error.</p><p><strong>udvLatency</strong>: integer 0 to infinity.</p><p> This parameter specifies the number of clocks it takes for the customer's supplied verilog code to generate an error.</p><p><strong>udvModuleName</strong>: a string</p><p>The name the customer wants to name the block they will edit.</p><p><strong>csr</strong>: {a JSON object}</p><p>A structure the customer uses to define the registers he wants to be created in his block. These registers will be accessible over the configuration network for the interconnect. Their functionality (Readable, writeable, reset value and etc) is controlled by the csr object.</p><p>In the future, the customer will be able to bring in signals from the boundary of Symphony and drive outputs to the boundary.</p>
