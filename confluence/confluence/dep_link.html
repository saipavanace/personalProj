Must be greater than 1.</p><p><strong>width</strong>: Width of list ID.</p><p><strong>headDeallocOnly</strong>: A boolean. To be set when only entries marked head are deallocated and false otherwise. Optimizes gates when set.</p><p><strong>useSmallArea</strong>: A boolean. An optimization parameter that when set encodes node pointers, hence reducing the number of flops.</p><p /><h2 id="dep_link-I/O">I/O</h2><p><strong>input</strong> alloc_en;                          // When set indicates that a new node is to be allocated</p><p><strong>input</strong> [width-1: 0] alloc_id;       // Specifies the ID of the list to which a node is to be added</p><p><strong>input</strong> [depth-1:0] alloc_idx;      // One hot encoded entry pointer where the new node is allocated</p><p><strong>input</strong> dealloc_en;                      // When set  indicatest that a node in a list is to be deallocated.</p><p><strong>input</strong> [depth-1:0]  dealloc_idx; // One hot encoded pointer that points to the node to be deallocated</p><p><strong>output</strong> [depth-1:0] valid_head_vec; // Vector in which bits set indicate the entries that store the heads of lists.</p><p /><h2 id="dep_link-Modulesused">Modules used</h2><p>None</p><p /><h2 id="dep_link-Description">Description</h2><p /><span class="confluence-embedded-file-wrapper image-center-wrapper"><img class="confluence-embedded-image image-center" src="https://arterisip.atlassian.net/wiki/download/attachments/262406184/image-20230622-130446.png?api=v2"></span><p /><p>The dep_link block implements a data-structure to manage allocation and deallocation of multiple linked lists or dependency link chains. In each cycle, a maximum of one node can be allocated and/or a maximum of one node can be deallocated. The block itself doesn’t maintain or store any data, but only manages the dependencies between nodes or entries in a list. This is achieved by storing pointers in each node that point to other nodes.</p><p /><p>The block maintains a table of entries, each of which can be allocated to a node in a linked list. The following states are stored in each node or entry:</p><p>Valid</p><p>When set indicates that the entry or node is valid.</p><p /><p>Pointer</p><p>A pointer of width, <em>width</em>, points to an entry in the table on which this node is dependent on. The head node pointer is ignored. But all other nodes must point to a valid entry or node in the table. The pointer can be stored either as one-hot encoded vector or a binary encoded vector to save area (when <em>useSmallArea</em> is set).</p><p>For each newly added node in the list, its pointer is set to point to the last (tail) node of the list.</p><p /><p>Head</p><p>When set indicates that this entry is used to store the head node of a linked list.</p><p /><p>Tail</p><p>When set, indicates that the node stored at this entry is the tail of a linked list.</p><p /><p>ID</p><p>This stores the ID of the list to which the node or entry belongs.</p><p /><p /><p /><p />
