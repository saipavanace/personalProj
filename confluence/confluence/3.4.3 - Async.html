<p>The async adapter is a unidirectional adapter that sits between two ATP links that run off of different clocks. The two clocks can be edge aligned or not.</p><h4 id="id-3.4.3-Async-Parameters">Parameters</h4><p><strong>depth</strong>: The depth must be 2 or greater. When the two clocks are not edge aligned, the depth must also be a power of 2.</p><p>When the two clocks are not edge aligned the read and write points are converted to Gray codes and passed through synchronizers. Because of this, if the two clock are close in frequency, a depth of 8 is optimal.</p>
