<h1 id="HW-SYMCodeReview-GroundRules">Ground Rules</h1><p>Before the meeting attendees must review the microarchitecture and code and send in their comments. The comments will be the only thing covered in the meeting.</p><p><br/></p><p>In order for someone to come and review your code, they have to be able to read it and understand it quickly. Because of this this necessitates the establishment of coding standards so this can happen.</p><p>There are two things we need to look at</p><ol><li>Javascript coding styles and comments</li><li>Verilog coding styles and comments</li></ol><h1 id="HW-SYMCodeReview-Javascript">Javascript</h1><p>We have javascript functions. We should review them as they are run into in the code, them mark off for future uses.</p><p>There are two contradictory styles that have been shown to reduce bugs</p><ol><li>Functional programming styles that reduce characters typed</li><li>Strongly typed variables use (no automatic conversions)</li></ol><p>In addition, for someone coming in to review the code, there's also been studies:</p><p>Self documenting coding styles where the code is the comments is preferable to styles where a lot of comments are needed to document what is being done. This is because it is really easy for the code comments to fall out of date wit the actual code. But this also in contradiction with functional programming styles.</p><p>Rules:</p><ol><li>For functions, it is preferable to pass a single object as opposed to a string of variables. If passing a string of variables, avoid optional variables.</li><li>Use library modules where possible.</li><li>If coding in a functional style you need to have good comments and they need to be kept up to date with the code.</li><li>A functional coding style is good for implement small functions and blocks.</li><li>Booleans need to written such that true and false or 1 and 0 can be used interchangeably. In other words, treat booleans like booleans and never checked for integer value. </li><li>We should be strongly typed because this aids in another person being able to understand what is being done. </li></ol><p style="margin-left: 30.0px;">if (integer) vs. if (Math.abs(integer)) &gt; 0)</p><h1 id="HW-SYMCodeReview-Verilog">Verilog</h1><p>Our hands are somewhat tied because of the restrictions coming in</p><ol><li>Can't use structures, interfaces are two dimensional arrays</li><li>Don't want comments in the code the customers could use to reversion engineer our special sauce.</li></ol><p>But we can help with generated code when debugging if we implemented some formatting rules. The question is do we want to do this? Code formatting is as good of indication of code function as good comments.</p>
