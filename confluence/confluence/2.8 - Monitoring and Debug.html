<p>Symphony provides monitoring and debug facility via two hardware blocks called the &quot;PMON Stats Block&quot; and the &quot;Link Prob&quot;.  The PMON Stats can receive events from either the link probe or the ATUs. Below is a diagram that shows how the PMON or debug and monitoring components can be connected in Symphony:</p><p> </p><p> </p><p><span class="confluence-embedded-file-wrapper image-center-wrapper confluence-embedded-manual-size"><img class="confluence-embedded-image image-center" height="400" src="https://arterisip.atlassian.net/wiki/download/attachments/16169462/image2019-11-8%2015:4:56.png?api=v2"></span></p><p> </p><p>The Link probe works as an unidirectional adapter with an ingress and an egress ATP interfaces. The Link Probe monitors packets on the link it is sitting on and can be used to generate events based on values in packet fields such as source, destination, request type, address range, an user bits. In addition, the both the initiator and target ATUs can generate events during context allocation and deallocation. The events captured by the Link Prob are then transported to the PMON Stats Block. <br/><br/>The PMON Stats block provides a pool of counters. Each of these can work in both counter and timer modes. The block also provides a set of configuration registers which configure the operation of the PMON Stats block. The PMON Stats block can be configured to: </p><ol><li>To select events that drive inputs of counter/timer such as start, stop, count.</li><li>Set timer modes, limit value, start, stop or reset timer through software, and read timer or counter values.</li><li>Generate events from timer events that in turn can be used in (1) (chaining timers).</li></ol><p>The conditions to generate events as well as the list of events to choose from for each timer input are to be specified through certain data-structure parameters to the Stats block. Using the above resources and the configuration registers to control them, the Stats block along with other blocks that can generate events, such as the ATUs, FW and the Link Probs can be used to support measurements such as:</p><ol><li>Bandwidth utilization and usage, </li><li>Latencies (min/max/avg),</li><li>Latency histogram or Latency binning.</li><li>Link utilization stats (idle, busy, bubbles).</li></ol>
