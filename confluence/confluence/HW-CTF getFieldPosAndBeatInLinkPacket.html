<p>This function returns the beat, bit start position and width of a field that exists in a packet description. The packet description can be a base packet description or link packet description.</p><p>It is called as follows:</p><p>var return_data =  getFieldPosAndBeatInLinkPacket(link_width,link_packet_def,field_name,match_style)</p><p>link_width : width of the link in bits</p><p>link_packet_def : <a href="https://arterisip.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/ENGR/pages/16156801/HW-CTF+packetDesc" data-linked-resource-id="16156801" data-linked-resource-version="1" data-linked-resource-type="page">HW-CTF packetDesc</a></p><p>field_name: text string used to match against fieldNames.</p><p>match_style: string Optional, default value is *. Values can be *, exact or num.</p><p>if match_style is *, field_name is matched against the beginning of the fieldNames in the packet description. In other words, if field_name is 8 characters long, and the fieldName in the packet is 12 characters long, field_name is compared against the first 8 characters of that 12 character fieldName and if those 8 characters match, it is considered a match.</p><p>if match_style is exact, field_name must match exactly.</p><p>If match_style is num, field_name must match pattern ^field_name_[0-9]+$.</p><p>It returns a variable with the following format:</p><p>return_data = an_array<br/>Each entry in the array is a bundle that has the structure:<br/> {field_beat: integer 0 - n, : where 0 is the first beat.<br/> field_pkt_pos: integer n: at which bit in the packet field starts.<br/> field_start: integer n, : at which bit in the beat the field starts.<br/> field_width: integer n, : how wide is the field.<br/> field_min_width: integer n, : If type F_, the min width, otherwise 0.<br/> field_merge_fn: string, : If type C_, the cloning function, otherwise &quot;&quot;. <br/> field_name: string, : name of the field matched.<br/> field_type: string, : type of field. It can take following legal values - &quot;H&quot;,&quot;N&quot;, &quot;F&quot;, and &quot;C&quot;.<br/> field_payload: integer 0-n : where 0 is header, 1 and greater are data-payloads }</p><p>If field_name is not found in the packetDesc, the width is returned as 0.</p><p>If the packetDesc has a syntax problem, width in the last array entry is returned as 0 and an error is printed out to console.log.</p><p><br/></p>
