<p>Static configs choices are checked in svn under verif/dmi/</p><p>Hnt replays are not handled yet in scoreboard. This should be handled as follows: When hint is replayed, it is cancelled by DUT. So on a 'cancel', we should mark the appropriate hint entry as having seen lookup, and not expecting axi transaction.</p><p>Look at 'TODO' in scoreboard and seq</p><p>Size calculation for mrds and dtws has a bug.

Make sure all possible data integrity checks are done.</p><p>Hashtags from testplan need to be put in scoreboard.</p><p>Cross between HNT/MRD/DTWs with cache isn't coded completely</p><p>v1.6 miscellaneous errors in regressions can be fixed if needed.</p><p>Knob for hitting same index over and over.</p><p>Checks for attribute based allocation are missing. We might want to add knobs to force certain attributes in the seq for a particular test.</p><p>With cache, the spec says that the DtrSysVis can't go out without the AXI BResp. This might be a spec bug. Add dv checks for  this, if this is based on attribute rather than always the same behavior.</p><p>A DTW doesn't have to always cause an AXI access. Make sure all cases why this may/may not happen have checks in scb.</p><p>Allocation is based on attribute in victim cache case. Also, in case of replay of MRD/WR, allocation attribute is suppressed per the uarch spec. These checks need to be added.</p><p>The pending counter stuff for WTT is hardcoded to 3. This should be piped from the GUI with the appropriate parameter.</p><p>Testplan is missing coverage for same address on: 1) fill and read 2) fill and flush 3) fill and write</p><p>Testplan is missing coverage for same address on 1) evict and write 2) rdrsp and write</p><p>Above two should be crossed with before / after and P0-P2 in pipeline when appropriate.</p><p>For static configs, there are certain parameters that are ignored / not thought of (esp for the CMC). These include (but not limited to) outstandingWrPerEntry, packedAddronMem, tagBanks, DataBanks, Replacement Policy, Memory Parts, CacheDInPipe, CacheDoutPipe, primary and secondary selection bits</p><p>QoS and security aren't in the static configs excel sheet.
