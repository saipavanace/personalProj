<h1 id="HW-CTFArchitecturalPerformanceModel-Introduction">Introduction</h1><p>The Architectural Performance Model (APM) is a bring up version of the eventual Performance model that the customers will use for Symphony. This model was developed with the intent of equipping the architects with an &quot;<em>approximately timed</em>&quot; software model that complements their understanding and highlights the impact of their architectural decisions on the system level performance. The model has several embedded parameters that can be tuned to achieve a cycle accurate representation of the design. The model is highly scalable and can currently handle any non-broadcast network topology. The scope of development of this model will be refined and reviewed as specified in the Scope section.</p><h1 id="HW-CTFArchitecturalPerformanceModel-ModelAttributes">Model Attributes</h1><h2 id="HW-CTFArchitecturalPerformanceModel-Language">Language</h2><p>APM is developed using C++, in combination with TLM2.0 libraries. TLM2.0 libraries provide a skeletal frame work to implement event driven sockets on the initiators (drivers) and targets (memories). This has greatly helped in speeding up the bring up time of this model.</p><h2 id="HW-CTFArchitecturalPerformanceModel-Components">Components</h2><p>The main components of the model, as it is currently defined, are listed below.</p><ul><li>Driver (Initiator)</li><li>Switch</li><li>Buffer</li><li>Target (Memory/Endpoint)</li></ul><p>Detailed descriptions on each of these components will be added subsequently.</p><h2 id="HW-CTFArchitecturalPerformanceModel-PerformanceMetrics">Performance Metrics</h2><p>The performance metrics reported by the model are defined by the architects. Currently, each component of the model generates a summarized report over each run. Each of the targets report the following metrics.</p><ul><li>Individual FLIT Latency</li><li>Min FLIT latency per target</li><li>Max FLIT latency per target</li><li>Average FLIT latency over active time, per target</li><li>Throughput per target</li><li>Cycles per FLIT (CPF) per target (An estimate of network utilization)</li></ul><p>Each of the drivers currently report the following metrics</p><ul><li>Transaction Count (Number of transactions issued)</li><li>Max Queue Size attained</li></ul><p><br/></p><h1 id="HW-CTFArchitecturalPerformanceModel-Scope">Scope</h1><h2 id="HW-CTFArchitecturalPerformanceModel-Schedule">Schedule</h2><p><br/></p><h2 id="HW-CTFArchitecturalPerformanceModel-ActionItems">Action Items</h2><p>This section is used to track the short and long term action items and scope of development of the APM.</p><ul><li>03/06/17 - Validate Switch Data - Ankit &amp; Bipin</li></ul><h1 id="HW-CTFArchitecturalPerformanceModel-SupportingDocsandPresentations">Supporting Docs and Presentations</h1><p>Board Presentation -</p><p><a href="/wiki/spaces/ENGR/pages/16329960/HW-CTF+Architectural+Performance+Model?preview=%2F16329960%2F16250458%2FArch+Model+Infrastructure.pdf"><span style="background: url('/wiki/s/-672721829/6452/d621ad2a33e27b90ca05c475b216bfab745e08a2/1000.0.0-d621ad2a33e2/_/download/resources/com.atlassian.confluence.plugins.confluence-view-file-macro:view-file-macro-resources/images/placeholder-medium-pdf.png'); width: 333px; height: 95px; display: inline-block; padding-top: 155px; margin: 2px; border: 1px solid #ddd; text-align: center; vertical-align: text-bottom; text-decoration: none; font-size: 12px; color: #000;">Arch Model Infrastructur…</span></a></p><p><br/></p><p><br/></p>
