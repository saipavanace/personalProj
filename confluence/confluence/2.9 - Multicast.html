<p>Multicast transactions are defined as transactions that originate at one node and are destined for multiple destinations. In general, multicast transactions can be supported either by sending &quot;N&quot; unicast transactions from the source to the &quot;N&quot; destinations or by sending unicast messages and then multicasting only at the point where necessary, that is, creating a tree structure and minimizing the fan out order at each node of the tree. </p><p>Symphony supports multicast transactions natively through the use of multicast stations and the multicast support provided in the I/T-ATU. The multicast station is the network element that is inserted at the location where the transaction needs to be multicasted within the multicast tree. The figure below illustrates two multicast trees originating from the same source. The figure also illustrates where the multicast stations are inserted in the Mesh (Switches circled with Red color)</p><p><span class="confluence-embedded-file-wrapper confluence-embedded-manual-size"><img class="confluence-embedded-image" height="250" src="https://arterisip.atlassian.net/wiki/download/attachments/16169456/image2019-11-19%2011:2:46.png?api=v2"></span></p><p>The multicast station as illustrated above is connected to the switches in both the request and the response network. In the 8x8 mesh above, the multicast stations are inserted at locations (1,3), (1,1) and (6,1). The figure also shows how the station is connected to the switch at those locations. </p><p>In Symphony, the multicast station performs two functions: 1) receives a multicast packet from the switch and fans-out the packet on to the appropriate links; and 2) aggregates the response packets for the multicast packets send on the request network and then transmits a single response packet to next upstream multicast station or the originating source node. This arrangement is illustrated inset in the above figure. The multicast station is connected to the Request as well as Response network. </p><p>There are two distinct ways: 1) Symphony automatically inserts and configures the multicast stations; and 2) the user manually configures the network elements which in this case include the I-ATU, T-ATU and the Multicast Stations. </p><p>Once the multicast tree has been setup, the user can choose to send user bits to identify which targets within the multicast tree the transaction is intended for. That is, by defining the user bits the user can define a sub-tree within the multicast tree to receive the transaction. </p>
