Many progresses have been made related to level of logic reduction and timing improvements.</p><p>More fixes are in the pipe mainly on DMI but they are not required for Mobileye.</p><p><u>Release notes:</u></p><p>This is in progress and the draft will be shared with JP.</p><p>Akarsh will double check the list of bugs and he will report the ones that impact Ncore 3.2 if any.</p><p> </p><p><strong>DV signoff status:</strong></p><p><u>Regressions:</u></p><p>Fsys passing rate went down from ~95%, mainly  impacted by 1 Jira ticket being investigated: CONC-11026</p><p>IO-AIU block passing rate is close to ~95% that is the target or that release (Mobileye features only)</p><p>All the other blocks have a passing rate of 99% to ~100%.</p><p><u>Functional coverage:</u></p><p>IO-AIU is not at the target and DV effort will continue to reach the passing criteria.</p><p> </p><p><strong>Performance models:</strong></p><p>A new bug found while testing the RC1 (AN-1730).</p><p>It is fixed now and it will be part of the RC2 build.</p><p> </p><p><strong>Documentation sets:</strong></p><p>Ncore 3.4 documentation sets is not yet available.</p><p>The release notes is going to be created for the RC likely early next week.</p><p> </p><p><strong>Maestro:</strong></p><p>Floorplan feature: it is visible in Maestro GUI, it can be gated by a license but no need to regenerate the ME license for now</p><p>Performance visualization: it is gated by license, not needed for now until ME asks for it</p><p> </p><p>The agreement is that the Ncore 3.4 RC2 is ok to be delivered to Mobileye tentatively before Sunday when they are back to work.</p><p>Next steps are below when the Ncore 3.4 RC2 is available later today:</p><p>Eric will generate the RTL from RC2 and check that the RTL is consistent with the one from RC1.</p><p>Tests are going to continue over the weekend with RC1 &amp; RC2.</p><p>Eric Howard &amp; JP will be the contact information for any support.</p><p>JP will send the greenlight to Santhosh to proceed with the delivery to Mobileye.</p><p> </p><p>Please let me know if anything is missing or unclear.</p>
