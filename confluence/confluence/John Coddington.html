To do this you have to add in temporary code and then remove it before checking in the logic.</li></ol></li><li>Attended a meeting reviewing the test plan for the Trace Sampling logic.</li><li>Spent time with Darshan discussing on how to more automate CPR mods in an Ncore environment.</li><li>Attending two integrations meetings that talked about how to integrate the new Trace and Messaging logic into Ncore blocks.</li><li>Reviewed an Ncore parameter document written by Junie.</li></ol>
