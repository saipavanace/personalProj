Tags are stored in the GDS II file as a series of formatted text lines. Previous IP Tagging implementations have been specific to cells and hard IP. Text tags instantiated in soft IP have not been recognized or carried forward by traditional EDA tools and are therefore not currently available in the GDSII database to verify actual implementation and usage. The tracking mechanism herein is not secure. It is susceptible to tampering and is intended only to facilitate the passing, use and sharing of information among honest IP users and IP providers; nevertheless, its existence does afford a very low-level form of security.</p><p> </p>
