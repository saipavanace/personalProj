<p><br/></p><div>Participants:<br/>Shailendra<br/>Bipin<br/>Dave<br/>Ron Sites (Macnica)<br/>Dave LeTourneau (Macnica)</div><div>- Macnica is a distributor for Altera</div><div>- Gave brief overview of what our goals are:<br/>  - Target system + our IP<br/>    - Dev board with FPGA SoC (have CPUs + peripherals)<br/>    - Want as much FPGA capacity as we can get, but important to<br/>      have SoC component to generate traffic on AXI interfaces<br/>  - Our IP + our transactors in constrained random regressions<br/>    - Want as much FPGA capacity as we can get<br/>      - Stratix-X has 4.5M logic elements - approximately 2.1 gates<br/>        per LE<br/>    - There are FPGA dev cards with 2 FPGAs on it<br/>      - Good target for multi-NoC testcases<br/>      - We could also use for inter-chip links when/if we do</div><div>- Questions regarding action items I had open from 3/22/17 meeting:<br/>  - Is there a way to have access to a CHI/ACE interface of FPGA SOC?<br/>    Response: They will contact Altera SoC team (located here in<br/>              Austin) and ask; may set up a meeting between them and us<br/>  - Have they heard of anyone doing cosimulation with FPGA emulation?<br/>    Response: They do not know of anyone doing this, but will ask<br/>  - Have they heard of anyone doing FPGA emulation on the AWS platform?<br/>    Response: They do not know of anyone doing this, but will ask</div><div>Other:<br/>- In general, buying a dev board comes with a 1 year license of Quartus<br/>  and non-third party IP (Quartus is Altera's synthesis and P&amp;R tool)<br/>- There are 3 versions of Quartus:<br/>  - LE: lite edition; free; limited capacity and FPGA family support<br/>  - SE: standard edition; not free <br/>  - PE: pro edition; not free; need for some FPGA families <br/>- The IP available has Avalon or AXI system interfaces. Avalon is an<br/>  Altera interface standard - I've downloaded a spec for this:<br/>  - If need be, we can create a gasket that converts Avalon to AXI. <br/>  - May want to look at if we want to support this protocol in Symphony.<br/>    I'm not pushing for it, but if we have to do a conversion between<br/>    Avalon and AXI, we are part way to supporting Avalon in Symphony.<br/>- Quartus is available to buy separately - it sounds like it comes with<br/>  a maintenance period of a year (can renew); if not renewed, you can<br/>  continue using, but locks you into that version of the SW<br/>- When we want, we can get a temp license of the Quartus tool; ditto<br/>  for a dev board. The temp license is good for 60 days; the dev board<br/>  access is more restrictive (they don't have many) - probably on the<br/>  order of a week<br/>- Macnica also reps emulation boards from Reflex and Bitware<br/>- The dev boards in general don't have connectors for LA (logic<br/>  analyzer) access; debug is mostly done through SignalTap - this<br/>  uses the 1149.1 bus. Dev kits come with the HW needed for this.<br/>  If we wanted a connector for LA access, they could connect us<br/>  with a third party who makes daughter cards with LA connectors.</div>
