<p>This document lists all the HW-SW testing done on every release (IR or RC). Depending on the maturity of the release, certain items may be skipped. Once we reach the RC process, all skipped items will be documented in the release check-list. </p><h2 id="ReleaseTesting-UITesting">UI Testing</h2><ol><li>Ensure that all software functionality is tested. Specific attention to be given to features that are new for this release. This is done with software unit testing. More details can be found at: <a class="external-link" href="https://confluence.arteris.com/display/ENGR/SW+Dev+Env+-+Ncore+Software+Processes" rel="nofollow">Software Development Process</a></li><li>All ARM core templates should work. This is tested by using every ARM core template in an APF and confirming that there are no errors seen.</li><li>Should be able to make a new APF from scratch. This is tested by making a new APF from scratch using the GUI.</li><li>Storage Amounts in all the different places in the UI are correct. This is tested by separately calculating the storage amount for every place it is displayed and comparing against what is displayed.</li></ol><h2 id="ReleaseTesting-CustomerAPFs">Customer APFs</h2><p>These customer APFs are delivered by the AE team.</p><p>For each APF, the Ncore tool is used to generate all possible outputs, each output is then validated as followed:</p><ul style="list-style-type: square;"><li>IPXACT file is checked as a valide XML file</li><li>UVM Testbench is compile and run using Cadence and Synopsys environment, all available test case are then ran and all test must have a PASS criteria from the final checker and no UVM_ERROR in the log<ul style="list-style-type: square;"><li>This is also tested using the following internal script: <a href="https://arterisip.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/OP/pages/16777472/Regressing+Customer+Test+bench+with+congen" data-linked-resource-id="16777472" data-linked-resource-version="7" data-linked-resource-type="page">Regressing Customer Test bench with congen</a></li></ul></li><li>Synthesis script are check only on a subset of the customer APF as it require long run time. The testing is done by running the Synopsys DC synthesis tool and ensuring the synthesis finish without error</li><li>SystemC models are first generated using provided Verilator tool, they are then compiled and finally integrated in a Synopsys Platform Architect project. The project is then simluated and traffic is sent through the interconnect to ensure correctness of all generated files.</li><li>Reports that are generated are viaully checked for discrepancy with the project or missing parts.</li><li>Parameter Coverage should be done to ensure there are no major gaps in these customer APFs. This is tested using the same parameter coverage set of scripts that is described in the Coverage section of <a href="https://arterisip.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/OP/pages/16777398/Verification+Processes" data-linked-resource-id="16777398" data-linked-resource-version="10" data-linked-resource-type="page">Verification Processes</a>.</li></ul><p>In addition, a visual check of the UI is done to ensure coherence in the parameters names and no regression in the behavior of the UI</p><h2 id="ReleaseTesting-PerformanceandAreaTesting">Performance and Area Testing</h2><ol><li>Area estimation should be tested against synthesis results for one pre-decided configuration. These numbers are compared against a previous release to look for unexpected and unexplained area changes.</li><li>Latencies and Bandwidth numbers should be generated from internal verification test benches and displayed. There will also be a table for the latency and bandwidth numbers from the previous release to allow side-by-side comparisons.</li><li>Frequency testing is done on one pre-decided configuration to see that all units meet timing at the frequency.</li></ol><h2 id="ReleaseTesting-Documentation">Documentation</h2><ol><li>Documentation should be reviewed by the Architect and other Engineering team members. This can be done in stages with the different document collaterals.</li></ol><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p>
