But currently facing few issues. Working on resolving them</p></li><li><p>For the external customer, we currently have a problem. We either have to give me ralgen, or csrCompile or something other tool and ask them to generate the register file themselves. To overcome this, I added a register generation script called “reg_gen“ which can be integrated into Maestro, after which, the customer will always have the register file and they done have to do anything else.</p></li></ol><p><u>Completed tickets:</u><br/>CONC-14683<br/>CONC-14392<br/>CONC-14679<br/>CONC-14468<br/>CONC-14715<br/>CONC-14718<br/>CONC-14377<br/>CONC-14077<br/>CONC-14704<br/>CONC-14672</p><p><u>Working On:</u></p><p>CONC-14714 (maestro issues)</p><ul><li><p>CONC-14715, CONC-14716, CONC-14718</p></li></ul><p><u>Open Maestro Tickets:</u></p><p>MAES-7336, MAES-7339, MAES-7341, MAES-7342, MAES-7343</p><p />
