<h2 id="ArchitectureProcesses-ArchitectureDefinitionFlow">Architecture Definition Flow</h2><p>The Architecture definition process take as primary inputs:  Product marketing requirements (MRD) and intended use cases from Marketing, along with a prioritization of these requirements and use cases.   These inputs are reviewed by the Architecture team, Technology office, the product development team and the Application Engineering team, and the feedback from these reviews is combined to create an initial aligned Product Requirements Document (PRD).  </p><p>The Architecture Specification Flow described below, begins in parallel with the finalization of the PRD, with the same set of inputs and reviews driving the initial releases of the Hardware Architecture Specification, 0.5, and Software Architecture Specification, 0.3. This HW Arch 0.5 release is used to begin Hardware development and to firm up requirements for the next, more detailed, release of Software Architecture Specification.  </p><p>Based on feedback from the hardware and software design teams and other reviewers, the next release of the HW Arch, 0.7, is generated.  In parallel, the Software Architecture Specification is also evolved to the 0.5 level, which is considered the first release of the SW Arch Spec which can be used to drive detailed software development.   From these releases, the Hardware and Software Architecture specifications are enhanced to the next level based on changing requirements and ongoing feedback from the development teams.   This results in the HW Arch 0.9 and SW Arch 0.7 specification releases.   At this level, the HW Arch Specification is considered complete with respect to enabling product development.  The Software Architecture specification will continue to evolve through one more feedback cycle, resulting in a comparable 0.9 release which is also considered complete for software development.</p><p>Post 0.9 release, feedback from implementation in the areas of feasibility and efficiency might result in further adjustments to the architectures. At the end of this step, when the full product is completed for initial release, the final implementation is reviewed to ensure that it is compliant with the updated the Hardware and Software Specifications.  These releases are considered final and published as 1.0.</p><p> </p><h2 id="ArchitectureProcesses-ArchitectureSpecificationFlow">Architecture Specification Flow</h2><p><span class="confluence-embedded-file-wrapper"><img class="confluence-embedded-image" src="https://arterisip.atlassian.net/wiki/download/attachments/16168983/Arch_flow.png?api=v2"></span></p><p> </p><p> </p>
