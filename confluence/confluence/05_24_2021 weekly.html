This feature supports setting or clearing of register bit/s when a different register and field is written to. This is still a temporary implementation. Need to discuss with Ncore about different use-case scenarios and also look for an equivalent field in IPXACT documentation in order to align with the semantics (if it exists in IPXACT).</li><li>Held meeting with Maestro team to understand flow dependencies, and determine requirements in order to provide DV with HDL paths/instance-hierarchy paths: <a class="external-link" href="https://confluence.arteris.com/pages/viewpage.action?spaceKey=ENGR&amp;title=2021-05-20+Meeting+notes%3A+Accessing+attributes+generated+by+design+TACHL+build+from+DV" rel="nofollow">https://confluence.arteris.com/pages/viewpage.action?spaceKey=ENGR&amp;title=2021-05-20+Meeting+notes%3A+Accessing+attributes+generated+by+design+TACHL+build+from+DV</a></li><li>Other than that been busy mostly with bug triage.</li></ul><p>-------------------------</p><p><br/></p><p><br/></p><p><br/></p>
