<p>Develop 8 STL files for top level bringup of IOAIU. Goal is to use same bringup tests to check basic accesses for different data bus widths, and whether ccp is present or not.</p><p> </p><p>Each STL file will consist of 16 transactions of a full cacheline (64 bytes), stepping 1 mb for each transaction, and having an idle 30 in between each transaction. The 8 tests will be developed as follows</p><p> </p><ul><li>4 STL files will be all reads, 4 STL files will be all writes.</li></ul><ul><li>4 STL files will be cacheline aligned, starting at address 0, and using burst type increment. The other 4 STL files will be aligned to middle of cacheline, starting at address 32 and using burst type wrap.</li></ul><ul><li>4 STL files will use coherent accesses, 4 STL files will use non-coherent accesses. Coherent accesses will set axcache=0xf, noncoherent accesses will set axcache=0x0. The 4 bits in the axache field are represented in STL file with  CACHE:1 BUF:1 CACHE_WR_ALOC:1 CACHE_RD_ALOC:1</li></ul><p> </p><p>The name of each test will be</p><p>ncore3_bringup_ABC.stl</p><p>where</p><ul><li>A= offset. &quot;rd&quot; for read. &quot;wr&quot; for write.</li><li>B = starting byte. &quot;0&quot; for cacheline aligned. &quot;32&quot; for mid cacheline.</li><li>C = coherency. &quot;nc&quot; for noncoherent, &quot;ch&quot; for coherent.</li></ul><p>Current location of tests is perf_vc/tests/stl/bringup</p><p> </p>
