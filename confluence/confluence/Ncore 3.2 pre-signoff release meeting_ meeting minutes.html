Timing results with Fusion Compiler are known and tracked in separated meeting.</p><p><u>hw_config_10_lite </u></p><p>The wort violated paths are related to the proxy-cache in ioaiu_top_g block.</p><p>96 OTTs is used because of the large timing violations with 128 OTTs @ 1.6GHz.</p><p>Projection is that the max frequency is limited to 1.2GHz instead of 1.6GHz with the proxy cache.</p><p><br/></p><p><strong>JIRA ticket for the release notes:</strong></p><p>The JIRA tickets review to decide the ones to be added to the release note is in progress. Follow-up meeting scheduled.</p><p><br/></p><p><strong><u>DV:</u></strong></p><p><strong>Regression pass rate:</strong></p><p>DVE and top level low pass rate is due to compilation failures during the RTL generation. Pass rate projected to be ~100% after the next run.</p><p><br/></p><p><strong>Code coverage:</strong></p><p>The average value of all the configuration will be reported instead of the min~max passing rate range.</p><p><br/></p><p><strong>Functional coverage</strong></p><p>The performance counter values have to be updated because the coverage is cumulative while the average value is reported.</p><p>There is no functional coverage pass criteria: this is best effort and judgment on the holes to insure all the functionality is covered.</p><p><br/></p><p><strong>Latency &amp; performance</strong></p><p>As of now, the bandwidth check is limited to Samsung and NXP configurations.</p><p>Missing expected values from Architect and verification flow to verify that the performances are met: to be deployed in next product release</p><p><br/></p><p><strong>Emulation</strong></p><p>The goal to be listed as well as the current achievements: to be provided by Roger/ Khaled</p><p><br/></p><p><strong><u>Maestro</u></strong>, <strong><u>Performance models</u></strong> and <strong><u>documentation</u></strong> sections have not been fully covered during the meeting and they will be reviewed offline =&gt; Bernard.</p><p><br/></p><p><strong><u>QA section</u></strong></p><p>Activity is on going and JIRA tickets are filled based on findings.</p><p>Create a dedicated QA label to easily sort the tickets and report them in the checklist =&gt; JP</p><p><br/></p><p><strong><u>Improvement</u></strong></p><p><strong>IP-XACT</strong></p><p>Verification to be added as a requirement to ensure the compatibility with IPD tools =&gt; Bernard</p><p><br/></p><p>Next review meeting will be scheduled when all the release criteria are met or waived with associated justifications.</p>
