<p>Several approaches were investigated. Results are presented in <a class="external-link" href="https://arterisip.atlassian.net/browse/MAES-4058" rel="nofollow">MAES-4058</a> and in <a class="external-link" href="https://arterisip.atlassian.net/browse/MAES-4383" rel="nofollow">MAES-4383</a>. In general, we experimented with almost <a class="external-link" href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/373142/what-techniques-can-be-used-to-speed-up-c-compilation-times" rel="nofollow">all known approaches</a> and results show that there is no &quot;silver bullet&quot;. 5% of time reducing is accompanied with great efforts of code refactoring of architecture redesign. Here is a list of ready-to-go solutions that can be applied to the project:</p><ol><li>HashString and HierString templates manual refactoring that substitutes them by non template implementations. Compile time reduction is around ~5%. Code can be found in the branch <a class="external-link" href="http://gitlab.arteris.com/maestro/maestro/-/tree/MAES-4383-prebuild-template-instances" rel="nofollow">MAES-4383-prebuild-template-instances</a></li><li>GCC option to avoid implicit template instantiating (<a class="external-link" href="https://gcc.gnu.org/onlinedocs/gcc/Template-Instantiation.html" rel="nofollow">GCC Template-Instantiation</a>). Compile time reduction isn't significant. Code can be found in the branch <a class="external-link" href="http://gitlab.arteris.com/maestro/maestro/-/tree/MAES-4383-explicit-template-instances" rel="nofollow">MAES-4383-explicit-template-instances</a></li><li><a class="external-link" href="https://buffered.io/posts/the-magic-of-unity-builds/" rel="nofollow">Unity-build pattern</a> that is simply combining all source files in one to avoid multiple similar operations that compiler does when operates on the source files. Compile time reduction is measured on libdata unit and results are worth to consider as an option to use in certain case by individual preferences. Code can be found in the branch <a class="external-link" href="http://gitlab.arteris.com/maestro/maestro/-/tree/MAES-4383-unity-build-pattern-to-recude-compile-time" rel="nofollow">MAES-4383-unity-build-pattern-to-recude-compile-time</a>. A custom CMake option <strong>UNITY_BUILD</strong> is provided for convenience. One can change the option value in order to select source files to be compiled. The main disadvantage of the pattern is that it requires efforts for maintenance of build recipes. However, it can reduce compilation time greatly as for libdata module experiment shows x2 time speed up</li></ol><p><br/></p>
