Randomizer (WIP):

Usage:
* node randomizer.js

Inputs:
* params.json (which constains all legal values)
* constraints.js (list all constraints between the parameters)

Output:
* random_config.tcl

Useful Commands:
* to invoke the above config: maestro -s random_config.tcl
* to save tcl from Maestro GUI: save_project -file <filename> -tcl

TODO Items for Randomizer:

* DVM versions is hardcoded, this needs to be randomized based on the type of units we have in the sytem
* Need to create initiatorGroups (genInitiatorGroups function) - get info from TCL library to do this
* Need to understand what this is: set_attribute -object $memInterleaveFunc -value_list $vals in the config
* connectivity should be handled for unconnected configs
* Need to randomize clock domains
* Number of snoop filters are always '1' -> Need to expand
* Number of sets in the snoop filter is always 16 * Number of DCEs (this is minimum. need to expand more)
* After increasing the snoop filters, we need to randomly pick one and assign it to a coherent agent.
* Number of GPRAs should be atleast nDIIs + 1 (for DMI). This is minimum. Increase it later
* Open constraints on axId widths on IOAIU (AXI), DMI, DII and find the relationship between them
* 2 CHIs are made as minimum in the params because we need atleast 2 Coherent agents in the system. Need to fix this to make it dynamic
